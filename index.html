<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>A House United: How the Church Can Save the World</h2><p><p>By entering the culture wars, churchgoers in the United States have ushered the Left and the Right to even greater extremes. Battles over moral issues like abortion rights and homosexuality have now widened to include taxation and size of government, so that specific church affiliation has become an accurate predictor of political party affiliation. The extremists in American politics rely on Christians to be the engine that pushes the culture farther right or left.</p><p>Allen Hilton believes that religion isn't inherently divisive, and he suggests a new role for Christianity. Jesus prayed that his disciples might all be one, and this book imagines a proper answer to that prayer in the context of American polarization.</p><p>Rather than asking people to leave their political and theological beliefs at the church door, Hilton promotes a Christianity that brings people together with their differences. Through God's transforming work, he writes, we can create a house united that will help our nation come back together.</p></p><p><p><b>Allen Hilton</b> is the founder and executive director of House United, a nonprofit initiative that helps groups collaborate across theological and political differences. He holds a PhD in New Testament from Yale University, where he served on the Divinity School faculty, and has led Christian formation in three large churches. Allen is a sought-after speaker on reconciliation and community building.</p><p>"Raised in conservative farm country, educated in liberal graduate schools, and having pastored congregations in settings across the entire country while teaching in both liberal arts colleges and theological seminaries, Allen Hilton is uniquely qualified to convene this most critical conversation. In a world that is becoming more sorted, enclaved, and factioned, Hilton dares to believe that if we really hear the words of Jesus, we can learn to come together in unity for the common good of the world. And not only can we, we must. With a scholar's insight and a pastor's heart, Hilton enters the fray and brings empathy, insight, winsomeness, and a bit of prophetic impatience to remind the followers of Jesus that we follow the divisiveness of our day at our own peril. Calling people of faith who have allowed the divisions of tribe and temperament to create chasms of distrust, this book is both bracing and encouraging, challenging and empowering. If you are a Christian leader, yearning to help your people be light in the darkness, make this your next read." --Tod Bolsinger, VP and chief of the Leadership Formation Platform at Fuller Theological Seminary and author of <i>Canoeing the Mountains</i></p> <p>"<i>A House United</i> should be required reading for every person who seeks to faithfully follow Jesus Christ during this tumultuous time in the church and in American culture. Allen Hilton challenges the church to take seriously Jesus's call to unity not simply for its own sake but for the sake of the world. His book is biblical, scholarly, well-documented, and readable. I am so grateful for Hilton's timely challenge." --Mary Beth Anton, director of the Women in Ministry Program at Princeton Theological Seminary</p> <p>"In <i>A House United</i> Allen Hilton makes an important declaration: polarization is not inevitable; things could be different. What a polarized world needs most of all is a unified Christian church. In pointing out the possibility of a path to a unified and big tent church, Hilton helps us move past our daily experiences of echo chambers that isolate, algorithms that segregate, and hermeneutics that justify our self-righteousness. <i>A House United</i> offers an approach to reading Scriptures together in humility as we become the unified, formed, and transformed people for whom the world groans in eager anticipation. This book should be read as shared congregational study throughout all of Christendom." --David Anderson Hooker, Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame</p> <p>"Allen Hilton's <i>A House United</i> dissects how our culture is deeply divided and sorting into tribalistic perspectives. But with erudition, wit, and insight, he shows a way to a better future. And surprise, it is the Christian church that could play a crucial role in reducing the venomous polarization poisoning our communal life. (Yes, the same Christian church that we imagine fuels much of the division could actually heal the rifts if it discovers its true role.) If you are a pastor looking for a book that merits a congregation-wide study, stop looking. This book will captivate, motivate, and exhilarate your congregation."</p> --Jim Keck, senior minister of First-Plymouth Church, UCC, in Lincoln, Nebraska<br><br><p>"In <i>A House United</i> Allen Hilton adroitly addresses the huge problem of alienation in American churches. He provides a brilliant blueprint on how we can come together on the goals we share, even when we disagree on methodology, without attacking each other's motivations. This book has huge potential to heal that growing rift, which would allow the misplaced focus and energy on what divides us to be directed toward the work we are called to and bring a smile to the face of Jesus." --Ward Brehm, author of <i>Bigger Than Me</i></p> <p>"In these days of divisive dialogue and virtual vitriol, we need more than social civility--we need deeply spiritual direction from the heart of a pastor. That's what we get from Allen Hilton: a brilliant, biblically based presentation of the problem and practical solutions for creating a brave new world rooted in Jesus's prayer that 'they may all be one.'" --John Ross, senior minister at Wayzata Community Church in Wayzata, Minnesota</p> <p>"In an America that is profoundly divided, the Christian church has largely capitulated to tribalism and failed to offer an alternative. Allen Hilton cogently analyzes this situation and calls the church to claim its deeper identity as a community of reconciliation and unity."</p> --Dwight J.

Author and award winning filmmaker Richard Martini explores startling new evidence for life after death, via the "life between lives," where we reportedly return to find our loved ones, soul mates and spiritual teachers. Based on transcripts of filmed between life sessions from his documentary "Flipside: Journey into the Afterlife" and the evidence of thousands of people who claim that under deep hypnosis, who claim they saw and experienced the same basic things about the Afterlife, the book interviews hypnotherapists around the world trained in the method pioneered by Dr. Michael Newton, as well as examining actual between life sessions. The author agrees to go on the same journey himself, with startling and candid results, learning we are fully conscious between our various incarnations, and return to connect with loved ones and spiritual soul mates, and together choose how and when and with whom we'll reincarnate. The author examines how "Karmic law" is trumped by "Free will," with souls choosing difficult lives in order to learn from their spiritually; no matter how difficult, strange or complex a life choice appears to be, it was made in advance, consciously, with the help of loved ones, soul mates and wise elders. Extensively researched, breathtaking in scope, "Flipside" takes the reader into new territory, boldly going where no author has gone before to tie up the various disciplines of past life regression. near death experiences, and between life exploration. In the words of author Gary Schwartz, Phd, once you've read "Flipside" "you'll never see the world in the same way again." Praise for &#x201c;FlipSide&#x201d;"Richard has written a terrific book. Insightful, funny, provocative and deep; I highly recommend it!" Robert Thurman ("Why the Dalai Lama Matters")&#x201c;Inspiring, well written and entertaining. The kind of book where once you have read it, you will no longer be able to see the world in the same way again.&#x201d;Gary E. Schwartz (&#x201c;The Sacred Promise&#x201d;)"Everyone should have a Richard Martini in their life." Charles Grodin ("If I Only Knew Then... What I Learned From Mistakes")</p><p>What happens after we die?<br><br>Author and award winning filmmaker Richard Martini explores startling new evidence for life after death, via the "life between lives," where we reportedly return to find our loved ones, soul mates and spiritual teachers.

Todd Burpo&#x2019;s experience is no different than Dr. Alexander&#x2019;s &#x2013; they&#x2019;re both essentially the same, and can be replicated using this form of therapy.<br><br>"I&#x2019;ve been a student of what happens after we die my whole life &#x2013; but I don&#x2019;t consider anyone an expert in this field, except Michael Newton who&#x2019;s been doing it longer than anyone.&nbsp; There are no universities that teach this research &#x2013; so I&#x2019;m a pioneer like anyone else who examines it.&nbsp; It deserves to be studied in the University setting and I&#x2019;m doing my best to get them to consider it to be studied scientifically."</p><h2>Flat Stanley 4 Books in 1!: Flat Stanley, His Original Adventure; Stanley, Flat Again!; Stanley in Space; Stanley and the Magic Lamp</h2><p><p>Four classic Flat Stanley adventures in a brand-new bind-up!</p><p>When a bulletin board falls on Stanley and makes him flat, the adventures begin!

Fascinating.&#x201d;</em>&#x2014;<b>New York Times bestselling author Steve Jackson</b><br><br>In 2016-17, while working for the USA TODAY NETWORK&#x2019;s Wisconsin Investigative Team, author John Ferak wrote dozens of articles examining the murder case again Steven Avery, who had already beat one wrongful conviction only to be charged with the murder of Teresa Halbach in 2005. The case became the wildly successful Netflix &#x201c;Making A Murderer&#x201d; documentary. <br><br>In WRECKING CREW: Demolishing The Case Against Steven Avery, Ferak lays out in exacting detail the post-conviction strategy of Kathleen Zellner, the high-profile, high-octane lawyer, to free Avery. To write this book, Zellner, perhaps America&#x2019;s most successful wrongful conviction attorney, gave Ferak unique access to the exhaustive pro bono efforts she and her small suburban Chicago law firm dedicated for a man she believes to be a victim of an unscrupulous justice system in Manitowoc County.</p><p>A native of Joliet, Illinois, John Ferak returned to his roots in 2017 to become the editor/reporter for the Joliet Patch. He previously spent five years with the Wisconsin Investigative Team for USA TODAY NETWORK and nine years in Nebraska at the Omaha World-Herald newspaper. He is an authority on wrongful arrest and conviction cases. His 2016 book for WildBlue Press, FAILURE OF JUSTICE, chronicled the nation&#39;s largest wrongful conviction case. His first book, BLOODY LIES told the story about a CSI director who went to prison for planting blood in high-profile Nebraska murder cases. Ferak&#39;s fifth true-crime book, WRECKING CREW: Demolishing The Case Against Steven Avery, is being published through Colorado-based WildBlue Press on November 20, 2018."John Ferak is an investigative journalist who is trying to figure out who committed the murder. He takes all of my evidence, expert opinions and theories and really examines them in detail. [<i>Making a Murderer</i>] touched on some of my investigation and expert experiments but not in as much detail as the book. The series explores many collateral matters, while the book zeroes-in on suspects and motives for the murder, which was not a focal point in the series."--Attorney Kathleen Zellner, interview with Newsweek Magazine<br><br>"If you're planning to binge-watch Making a Murderer 2 over the holidays, order John Ferak's new book Wrecking Crew, too.

Just walked in and said, &#x201c;Mr. Sullivan, I want a fight with Dick Abro.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now Dick Abro was one of the four or five best heavyweights in the racket and who this kid was I didn&#x2019;t know. What I did know was that if he rated a fight with anybody even half so good as Dick Abro, his name would have been in every news sheet in the country.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first I thought the guy was a nut. Then I took another look, and whatever else you can say, the kid had all his buttons. He was a tall, broad-shouldered youngster with a shock of wavy brown hair and a nice smile. He looked fit, too, his weight was around one eighty. And Abro tipped the beam at a plenty tough two hundred.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen, kid,&#x201d; I said, shoving my hat back on my head and pointing all four fingers at him. &#x201c;I never saw you before. But if you were twice as good as you think you are, you still wouldn&#x2019;t want any part of Dick Abro.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mr. Sullivan,&#x201d; he said seriously, &#x201c;I can beat him. I can beat him any day, and if you get me the fight, you can lay your money he will go out in the third round, flatter than ten pancakes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> What would you have said? I looked at this youngster, and then I got up. When I thought of that wide, brown face and flat nose of Abro&#x2019;s, and those two big fists ahead of his powerful shoulders, it made me sick to think what would happen to this kid.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a sap!&#x201d; I said, hard-boiled. &#x201c;Abro would slap you dizzy in half a round! Whatever gave you the idea you could take that guy?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d laugh if I told you,&#x201d; he said quite matter-of-factly<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m laughing now,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You come in here asking for a fight with Abro. You&#x2019;re nuts!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His face turned red, and I felt sorry for the kid. He was a nice-looking boy, and he did look like a fighter, at that.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You tell me. What made you think you could lick Abro?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I dreamed it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> You could have knocked me down with an axe. He dreamed it! I backed up and sat down again. Then, I looked up to see if he was still there, and he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like this, Mr. Sullivan,&#x201d; he said seriously. &#x201c;I know it sounds goofy, but I dream about all my fights before I have them. Whenever I get a fight, I just train and never think about it. Then, a couple of nights before the fight, I dream it. Then I get in the ring and fight like I did in the dream, and I always win.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, I thought if Dick Abro ever smacked this lad for a row of channel buoys, he&#x2019;d do a lot of dreaming before he came to. Still, there&#x2019;s a lot of nuts around the fight game. At best, and it&#x2019;s the grandest game in the world, it&#x2019;s a screwy one. Funny things happen. So I tipped back in my chair and looked up at him, rolling a quid of chewing gum in my jaws.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah? Who&#x2019;d you ever lick?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Con Patrick, in two rounds. Beetle Kelly in four, Tommy Keegan in three. Then I beat a half dozen fellows before I started to dream my fights.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew these boys he mentioned. At least, I knew one of them personally and two by their records. None of them were boys you could beat by shadowboxing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When&#x2019;d you have this pipe about Abro?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;About a week ago. I went to see the pictures of his fight with the champ. Then, two weeks ago I saw him knock out Soapy Moore. Then I dreamed about fighting him. In the dream, I knocked him out with a right hook in the middle of the third.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I got up. &#x201c;You got some gym stuff?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> He nodded. &#x201c;I thought maybe you&#x2019;d want to see me box. Doc Harrigan down in Copper City told me to see you soon as I arrived.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Harrigan, eh?&#x201d; I rolled that around with my gum a few times. Whatever else Harrigan might be, and he was crooked enough so he couldn&#x2019;t even play a game of solitaire without trying to cheat without catching himself at it, he did know fighters.<br> &nbsp;<br> We walked down to the gym, and I looked around. There were a couple of Filipinos in the ring, and I watched them. They were sure slinging leather. That man Sambo they tell about in the Bible who killed ten thousand Filipinos with the jawbone of an ass must have framed the deal. Those boys can battle. Then, I saw Pete McCloskey punching the heavy bag. I caught his eye and motioned him over. The kid was in the dressing room changing clothes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Listen, Pete,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You want that six-round special with Gomez?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I sure do, Finny,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I need it bad.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll fix it up. But you got to do me a favor. I got a kid coming out on the floor in a couple of minutes, and I want to see is he any good. Watch your step with him, but feel him out, see?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I get it. You don&#x2019;t want him killed, just bruised a little, eh?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The kid came out and shadowboxed a couple of rounds to warm up. Pete was looking him over, and he wasn&#x2019;t seeing anything to feel happy about. The kid was fast, and he used both hands. Of course, many a bum looks pretty hot shadowboxing.<br> &nbsp;<br> When they got in the ring, the kid, who told me his name was Kip Morgan, walked over and shook hands with Pete. Then he went back to his corner, and I rang the bell.<br> &nbsp;<br> McCloskey came out in a shell, tried a left that the kid went away from, and then bored in suddenly and slammed a wicked right to the heart. I looked to see Morgan go down, but he didn&#x2019;t even draw a breath. He just stepped around, and then, all of a sudden, his left flashed out in four of the snappiest, shortest jabs I ever saw. Pete tried to slide under it, but that left followed him like the head of a snake. Then, suddenly, Pete and I saw that opening over the heart again. And when I saw what happened I was glad I was outside the ring.<br> &nbsp;<br> McCloskey hadn&#x2019;t liked those lefts a bit, so when he saw those open ribs again, he uncorked his right with the works on it. The next thing I knew, Pete was flat on his shoulders with his feet still in the air. They fell with a thump, and I walked over to the edge of the ring. Pete McCloskey was out for the afternoon, his face resting against the canvas in a state of calm repose. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to disturb him.<br> &nbsp;<br> THAT NIGHT I dropped in on Bid Kerney. Race Malone, the sportswriter, was sitting with him. We talked around awhile, and then I put it up to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What you doing with Abro?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Got anybody for him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Abro?&#x201d; Bid shrugged. &#x201c;Heck, no. McCall wants the champ, an&#x2019; Blucher wants McCall. There ain&#x2019;t a kid in sight I could stick in there that could go long enough to make it look good. Even if I knew one, he wouldn&#x2019;t fight him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s in it?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;You make it ten grand, and I got a guy for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Race looked up, grinning. &#x201c;For ten grand I have, too. Me! I&#x2019;d go in there with him for ten grand. But how long would I last?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This kid&#x2019;ll beat Abro,&#x201d; I said coolly, peeling the paper off a couple of sticks of gum casually as I could make it. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll stop him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You nuts?&#x201d; Kerney sneered. &#x201c;Who is he?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Name of Morgan, Kip Morgan. From over at Copper City. Stopped Patrick the other night. Got ten straight kayos. Be fighting the champ in a year.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When I talked it up so offhand, they began wondering. I could see Malone smelling a story, and Bid was interested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But nobody knows him!&#x201d; Bid protested. &#x201c;Copper City&#x2019;s just a mill town. A good enough place, but too far away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, getting up. &#x201c;Stick him in there with Charlie Gomez. But after he beats Gomez, it&#x2019;ll cost you more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If he beats him, it&#x2019;ll be worth it!&#x201d; Bid snapped. &#x201c;Okay, make it the last Friday this month. That gives you two weeks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When I walked out of there, I was feeling good. There would be three grand in this, anyway, and forty percent of that was a nice cut these days. Secretly, I was wondering how I could work it to make the kid win. He had some stuff. I&#x2019;d seen that when he was in there with Pete, and while Gomez was tough, there was a chance. Pete was fighting Tommy Gomez, Charlie&#x2019;s brother, so he would be training. That took care of the sparring partner angle.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Abraham (The Petersheim Brothers)</h2><p><b><i>Known as &#x201c;The Peanut Butter Brothers&#x201d; for their Wisconsin family business, hardworking Andrew, Abraham, and Austin Petersheim have their plates too full for romance&#x2014;until their little siblings decide to play matchmaker . . .</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> With their house full to bursting since <i>Mammi</i> and <i>Dawdi</i> moved back in, the Petersheim twins know the only way to get their bedroom back is to get their older brothers married off.

On its appearance in 1859 it was immediately recognized by enthusiasts and detractors alike as a work of the greatest importance: its revolutionary theory of evolution by means of natural selection provoked a furious reaction that continues to this day.<br><i><br>The Origin of Species</i> is here published together with Darwin&#x2019;s earlier <i>Voyage of the &#x2018;Beagle</i>.&#x2019; This 1839 account of the journeys to South America and the Pacific islands that first put Darwin on the track of his remarkable theories derives an added charm from his vivid description of his travels in exotic places and his eye for the piquant detail.<br><br></p></p><p>CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England, to a wealthy intellectual family, his grandfather being the famous physician Erasmus Darwin. At Cambridge University he formed a friendship with J. S. Henslow, a professor of botany, and that association, along with his enthusiasm for collecting beetles, led to &#x201c;a burning zeal,&#x201d; as he wrote in his&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>, for the natural sciences. When Henslow obtained for him the post of naturalist on H.M.S.&nbsp;<i>Beagle</i>, the course of his life was fixed. The five-year-long voyage to the Southern Hemisphere between 1831 and 1836 would lay the foundation for his ideas about evolution and natural selection. Upon his return Darwin lived in London before retiring to his residence at Down, a secluded village in Kent. For the next forty years he conducted his research there and wrote the works that would change human understanding forever. Knowing of the resistance from the orthodox scientific and religious communities, Darwin published&nbsp;<i>The Origin of Species</i>&nbsp;in 1859 only when another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently reached the same conclusions. His other works include&nbsp;<i>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i>&nbsp;(1871) and&nbsp;<i>Recollections of My Mind and Character</i>, also titled&nbsp;<i>Autobiography</i>&nbsp;(1887). Charles Darwin&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Diary of the Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle</i>&nbsp;was published posthumously in 1933. Darwin died in 1882; he is buried in Westminster Abbey.Suppose we measure the power of a scientific theory as a ratio: how much it explains divided by how much it needs to assume in order to do that explaining. By this criterion, Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution by natural selection is second to none. Think of what it explains &#x2014; and I really mean explains in the fullest sense of the word: your existence and mine; the form, diversity, and apparently designed complexity and elegance of all living things, not only on this planet but probably wherever in the universe organized complexity may be found. The explanatory work that the theory does, then &#x2014; the numerator of the ratio &#x2014; is immense. But the theory itself &#x2014; the denominator &#x2014; could hardly be smaller or more simple; you can write it out in a phrase: &#x2018;Non-random survival of randomly varying hereditary elements.&#x2019; That isn&#x2019;t quite how Darwin himself would have put it (he phrased it in terms of the survival and reproduction of individual organisms). But it captures the essence of his idea in a way that &#x2014; I am convinced &#x2014; he would recognize and, indeed, enjoy if he were alive today.We can probably pare the denominator down even further, to a single essential: heredity. Given that there exists a system of high fidelity copying, two things will follow immediately: there will be a population of the entities copied; and, since no copying process is perfect (there is mutation, in other words), they won&#x2019;t all be exactly the same. It then follows that successful hereditary types will tend to increase in number at the expense of unsuccessful hereditary types. That is probably all that is needed for life to get going and, given enough time, to evolve living machinery whose complexity and diversity progresses without obvious limit.Consider where we would be without Darwin&#x2019;s idea. We&#x2019;d presumably have some sort of science of biology. Students would take degrees in the subject, books would be written, Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine would be won. We might know in some detail how living organisms work; we&#x2019;d know that a human body is a teeming army of cells, a thousand times more numerous than the people in the world; we&#x2019;d know that every one of these cells is a mass-production moleculefactory packed with the membranous equivalent of miles of sophisticated conveyor belt. We&#x2019;d know a great deal about how our bodies work, and how the bodies of shrimps, elephants and redwood trees work. We&#x2019;d be compelled to recognize how complicatedly organisms are fitted to survive in their particular worlds. But we wouldn&#x2019;t have the foggiest idea why. We&#x2019;d read volumes about living things but we wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue about where they came from originally nor why they work so efficiently and purposefully. It would undoubtedly be the most baffling problem in biology &#x2014; probably in the whole of science and the whole of philosophy. This was the problem that Darwin decisively solved. We are now as certain as one can ever be in science that a version of Darwin&#x2019;s solution is the correct one.The Darwinian solution to the riddle of existence is so powerfully simple, so felicitous to the modern mind, that it is hard for us to understand why it had to wait until the midnineteenth century before anyone thought of it. It is further surprising &#x2014; and probably telling &#x2014; that this great inspiration, which looks so elegant from the modern armchair, eluded centuries of philosophers, mathematicians and polymaths. Plato and Aristotle never even got close, fooling about with &#x2018;essences&#x2019; and &#x2018;ideal forms&#x2019;; Leibnitz and Newton gave us calculus (which might seem a more exacting intellectual achievement) but not an inkling of the reason for our own existence; Hume would surely have recognized the idea as a great one if it had occurred to him, but it never did. Having eluded this galaxy of all-time talent, the answer finally came, almost simultaneously, to two English naturalists. Darwin and Wallace, they alone, thought of it.For we must not forget Alfred Russel Wallace. This happens to Wallace quite often, I am afraid. He tends to get a poor deal at the hands of posterity, partly through his own generous nature. It was Wallace himself who coined the word &#x2018;Darwinism&#x2019;, he regularly referred to it as Darwin&#x2019;s theory and he referred to himself as &#x2018;more Darwinian than Darwin&#x2019;. The main reason we know Darwin&#x2019;s name more than Wallace&#x2019;s is that Darwin went on, a year later, to publish <i>The Origin of Species. </i>The <i>Origin </i>not only explained and advocated the Darwin/Wallace theory of natural selection as the mechanism of evolution. It also &#x2014; and this had to be done at book length &#x2014; set out the multifarious evidence for the <i>fact </i>of evolution itself.Given the failure of great philosophers and other thinkers throughout history to tumble to the breathtakingly powerful yet simple principle of natural selection, it is worth attending to the story of Darwin and Wallace, in case the similarities between them are revealing. The drama of how Wallace&#x2019;s letter arrived at Downe House on 18 June 1858, casting Darwin into an agony of indecision and worry, is too well known for me to retell it. In my view the whole episode is one of the more creditable and agreeable in the history of scientific priority disputes &#x2014; precisely because it wasn&#x2019;t a dispute, although it so very easily could have become one. It was resolved amicably, and with heartwarming generosity on both sides, especially, I must say, on Wallace&#x2019;s. As Darwin later wrote:Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards followed in my <i>Origin of Species </i>; yet it was only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got through about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown, for early in the summer of 1858 Mr Wallace, who was then in the Malay archipelago, sent me an essay <i>On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original Type </i>; and this essay contained exactly the same theory as mine. Mr Wallace expressed the wish that if I thought well of his essay, I should send it to Lyell for perusal. The circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and Hooker to allow of an extract from my MS., together with a letter to Asa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with Wallace&#x2019;s Essay, are given in the <i>Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society</i>, 1858, p. 45. I was at first very unwilling to consent, as I thought Mr Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his disposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray . . . had neither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr Wallace&#x2019;s essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and quite clear. Nevertheless our joint productions excited very little attention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember was by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable length in order to arouse public attention.Darwin was over-modest about his own two papers which were read at the Linnean Society. Both are models of the explainer&#x2019;s art. Wallace&#x2019;s paper is also very clearly argued. His ideas were, indeed, remarkably similar to Darwin&#x2019;s own, and there is no doubt that Wallace arrived at them independently. In my opinion the Wallace paper needs to be read in conjunction with his earlier paper, published in 1855 in the <i>Annals and Magazine of Natural History</i>. Darwin read this paper when it came out. Indeed, it led to Wallace joining his large circle of correspondents, and to his engaging Wallace&#x2019;s services as a collector. But, oddly, Darwin did not see in the 1855 paper any warning that Wallace was by then a convinced evolutionist of a very Darwinian stamp. I mean Darwinian as opposed to the Lamarckian view of evolution which saw modern species as all on a ladder, changing into one another as they moved up the ladder. By contrast Wallace, in 1855 had a clear view of evolution as a branching tree, exactly like Darwin&#x2019;s famous diagram which became the only illustration in <i>The Origin of Species. </i>The 1855 paper, however, made no mention of natural selection or the struggle for existence.That was left to Wallace&#x2019;s 1858 paper, the one that hit Darwin like a lightning bolt. Here, Wallace even used the phrase &#x2018;Struggle for Existence&#x2019;, and he devoted considerable attention to the exponential increase in numbers (another key Darwinian point). Wallace wrote:The greater or less fecundity of an animal is often considered to be one of the chief causes of its abundance or scarcity; but a consideration of the facts will show us that it really has little or nothing to do with the matter. Even the least prolific of animals would increase rapidly if unchecked, whereas it is evident that the animal population of the globe must be stationary, or perhaps . . . decreasing.Wallace deduced from this thatThe numbers that die annually must be immense; and as the individual existence of each animal depends upon itself, those that die must be the weakest . . .Wallace&#x2019;s peroration could have been Darwin himself writing:The powerful retractile talons of the falcon- and the cat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those animals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier and less highly organized forms of these groups, those always survived longest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey. Neither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for the purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its antitypes with a longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh range of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and on the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them. Even the peculiar colours of many animals, especially insects, so closely resembling the soil or the leaves or the trunks on which they habitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in the course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, yet those races having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies would inevitably survive the longest. We have also here an acting cause to account for that balance so often observed in nature, &#x2014; a deficiency in one set of organs always beingcompensated by an increased development of some others &#x2014; powerful wings accompanying weak feet, or great velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for it has been shown that all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency occurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this principle is exactly like that of thecentrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident.The image of the steam governor is a powerful one which, I can&#x2019;t help feeling, Darwin might have envied. Historians of science have raised the suggestion that Wallace&#x2019;s version of natural selection was not quite so Darwinian as Darwin himself believed. Wallace persistently used the word &#x2018;variety&#x2019; as the level of entity at which natural selection acts, for example in the long passage I have just quoted. And some have suggested that Wallace, unlike Darwin who clearly saw selection as choosing among <i>individuals, </i>was proposing what modern theorists rightly denigrate as &#x2018;group selection&#x2019;. This separated groups or races of individuals. But I believe a careful reading of Wallace&#x2019;s paper rules it out. I think that by &#x2018;variety&#x2019; Wallace meant what we would nowadays call &#x2018;genetic type&#x2019;, even what a modern population geneticist (as opposed to molecular geneticist) might mean by a gene. I think that, to Wallace in this paper, variety meant not local race of eagles, for example, but &#x2018;that set of individual eagles whose talons were hereditarily sharper than usual&#x2019;.If I am right, it is a similar misunderstanding to the one suffered by Darwin, whose use of the word &#x2018;race&#x2019; in the subtitle of <i>The Origin of Species </i>is sometimes misread in support of racialism. That subtitle, or alternative title rather, is <i>The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. </i>Once again, Darwin was using &#x2018;race&#x2019; to mean &#x2018;that set of individuals who share a particular hereditary characteristic, such as sharp talons&#x2019;, <i>not </i>a geographically distinct race such as the Hoodie Crow. If he had meant that, Darwin too would have been guilty of the group selection fallacy. I believe that neither Darwin nor Wallace were. And, by the same token, I do not believe that Wallace&#x2019;s conception of natural selection was different from Darwin&#x2019;s. As for the calumny that Darwin plagiarized Wallace, that is rubbish. The evidence is very clear that Darwin did think of natural selection before the younger man, although he did not publish it. We have his abstract of 1842 and his longer essay of 1844 both of which establish his priority clearly, as did his letter to Asa Gray of 1857 which was also read out at the Linnean Society in 1858. Why he delayed so long before publishing is one of the great mysteries of the history of science. Some historians have suggested that he was afraid of the religious implications, others the political ones. Maybe he was just a perfectionist.</p><h2>If Dogs Run Free</h2><p><b>WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE</b><br> <br>Music icon Bob Dylan and acclaimed illustrator Scott Campbell team up in this delightful interpretation of Dylan&#x2019;s 1970 song, &#x201c;If Dogs Run Free&#x201d;!<br><br><i>If dogs run free,</i><br><i>Why not we?</i><br> <br>In this quirky, spirited interpretation of Bob Dylan&#x2019;s 1970 song, &#x201c;If Dogs Run Free,&#x201d; illustrator Scott Campbell brings Dylan&#x2019;s lyrics to life as a celebration of the freedom and creativity of childhood.

Explaining where true purpose lies and demystifying where it doesn't, Craig offers the methods through which anyone can find their purpose. He identifies three pathways that will assess where you are with your purpose and where you should be going. <br><br>Illustrated by case studies of leaders from all walks of life and industries, Craig shares their unique stories to show how top leaders are energized by their purpose, finding in it the confidence they need to properly evaluate high-stakes decisions and take the optimal action. The best leaders access their purpose especially when facing the unknown, drawing on the source of it to energize themselves. Purpose also redefines their relationships to stress, allowing them to thrive where others just survived, and to postpone momentary, fleeting rewards in favor of leaving a sustained, meaningful impact. <br><br>Accessible, methodical, and eminently practical, <i>Leading from Purpose </i>offers the comprehensive toolbox with which everyone--whether a c-suite executive of behind-the-scenes office worker--can live out their purpose and achieve success on their own terms. <br><br>If you find yourself in an organization that is struggling to live its purpose, Craig's insights on how to bring your purpose and the organization's purpose into the same room at the same time is game-changing and will redefine your life and career.</p><p><b>Nick Craig</b> is the president and founder of the Authentic Leadership Institute, where he has guided over 5000 executives in the last ten years on the journey to discover and lead with purpose and has worked with organizations including GE, Unilever, Goldman Sachs, and West Point Military Academy.<br><b>One of Girl Boss' "Career Advice Books That'll Help Light a Fire Under Your A**"</b><br><br>"Caution: This is a book about purpose.

With unprecedented archival access and definitive scope, Charles Marsh captures the life of this remarkable man who searched for the goodness in his religion against the backdrop of a steadily darkening Europe. From his brilliant student days in Berlin to his transformative sojourn in America, across Harlem to the Jim Crow South, and finally once again to Germany where he was called to a ministry for the downtrodden, we follow Bonhoeffer on his search for true fellowship and observe the development of his teachings on the shared life in Christ. We witness his growing convictions and theological beliefs, culminating in his vocal denunciation of Germany&#x2019;s treatment of the Jews that would put him on a crash course with Hitler. Bringing to life for the first time this complex human being&#x2014;his substantial flaws, inner torment, the friendships and the faith that sustained and finally redeemed him&#x2014;<i>Strange Glory</i> is a momentous achievement.</p><p>Charles Marsh is a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia and director of the Project on Lived Theology.

The ritual eventually became a game, with each child concentrating on the word to clear the mind of distractions. And on funeral days, as horse-�drawn hearses approached the cemetery that lay just to the north, the twins would watch from their bedroom window.<br><br>Eternity. Ewigkeit.<br><br>Sabine found the word &#x201c;very long and gruesome.&#x201d; Dietrich found it majestic: an &#x201c;awesome word,&#x201d; he called it.<br><br>Sometimes he would picture himself on his deathbed, surrounded by family and friends, reclining on the threshold of heaven. He knew what his last words would be and sometimes rehearsed them aloud, though he dared not reveal them to anyone.He hoped to welcome death as an expected guest&#x2014;�he did not want to be taken by surprise. But, sometimes, when he went to bed convinced that death would come that very night, he would grow light-�headed, and the walls of his bedroom would reel about, as if he were at the axis of a carousel. He imagined himself rushing from sister to brother, from father to mother, pleading for help. The prospect of its happening now&#x2014;�of his vanishing tonight into the vast mysterium&#x2014;felt so real he had to bite his tongue to reassure himself that he was still among the living. That he could feel mortal pain. At such moments, he worried that he suffered from an &#x201c;incurable fear.&#x201d;<br><br>When the twins got separate bedrooms they devised a code for keeping up their metaphysical games. Dietrich would drum lightly on the wall with his fingers, an &#x201c;admonitory knock&#x201d; announcing that it was time once again to ponder eternity. A further tap signaled a new reflection on the solemn theme, and so it went, back and forth, until one of them discerned the final silence&#x2014;usually it was Dietrich. And with the game concluded, he lay awake, the only light in his room coming from a pair of candle-�lit crosses his mother had placed atop a corner table. &#x201c;When at night I go to bed, fourteen angels round my stead,&#x201d; he would hear her sing. He liked the idea very much: one angel &#x201c;dressed in a little white cloak,&#x201d; standing by his bed, and others watching over children everywhere.<br><br>Dietrich believed the nightly ritual spared him from &#x201c;being devoured by Satan,&#x201d; Sabine later wrote, though there are few references to Satan in her brother&#x2019;s adult writings, early or late. Ultimately, death would enthrall more than it frightened, and the devil would frighten him hardly at all. &#x201c;God does not want human beings to be afraid,&#x201d; he would one day preach to the congregation in a posh London suburb. God&#x2019;s only desire is that people &#x201c;reach out &#x2018;passionately&#x2019; and &#x2018;hungrily&#x2019; for mercy and love and . . . grace.&#x201d;<br><br>Unlike most Protestant theologians of the twentieth century, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was not the child of a minister. The sixth of eight children (his twin being the seventh), he was born on February 4, 1906, in Breslau, into a family of prodigiously talented humanists, who preferred spending religious holidays in the festive company of relatives and friends rather than in church. &#x201c;Popguns, soldiers!&#x201d; he wrote in his first letter to Father Christmas. Over the years he would ask for musical instruments, suits of clothes, fur hats, shirts and ties, trips abroad, shoes for every occasion, and the works of Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel. His wishes were most often granted.<br><br>The family lived at 9 Birkenw�ldchen Strasse in the affluent Breslau suburb of Scheitnig. Across the street a narrow park traced the bend in the Alte Oder River south beyond the Dombr�cke to the city zoo and Bishop&#x2019;s Forests; to the north, a path cut through dense pine woods to the cemetery and to the psychiatry and nerve clinic, where Dietrich&#x2019;s father worked. Sabine recalled a summer afternoon when her twin brother disappeared after the call to dinner. It was during a heat wave in lower Silesia. Dietrich, tanned and sporting &#x201c;a shock of flaxen hair,&#x201d; had been larking about in the backyard hoping to ward off the midges. Finally, he took shelter in a garden niche deep in the overgrown field between the rose arbor and the edge of the property. As his nursemaid stood on the veranda, repeating the dinner call, Dietrich paid no mind. Heedless of the heat and the fading light, he was content in the solitude of his secret place in the summer garden.<br><br>With its thick walls, narrow windows, and piercing spires, the house stood on the eastern bank of the Alte Oder, off a cobblestone street abutting another narrow wood. Arches and corbels enlivened the brickwork, and touches of Gothic-�Baroque appeared in the finials, overhangs, and trussing. A hipped roof and screened-�in porch entry, with deep eaves and dormer and eyebrow windows, gave the impression of a Low German farmhouse extending whimsically in every direction.<br><br>But for the rose arbor and a small vegetable garden, both carefully tended, the backyard was left to grow wild, according to fashion. Hens and roosters skittered about the yard and across the aging tennis court. Goats and sheep roamed freely in and out of the stables and even into the house when the doors were left open. Dietrich&#x2019;s mother kept a children&#x2019;s zoo with &#x201c;rabbits, guinea pigs, turtledoves, and squirrels,&#x201d; a terrarium with lizards, and snakes, and &#x201c;collections of birds&#x2019; eggs and mounted beetles and butterflies.&#x201d; In the shade of a linden tree, Dietrich&#x2019;s father and older brothers built a tree house on dark piers, a latticework affair with a small stage for skits. One summer, Dietrich helped those same older siblings dig an underground passageway from the arbor to a boulder. Beyond the family&#x2019;s three acres lay what the neighborhood children called &#x201c;the wilderness.&#x201d; There the land rolled softy toward the river and into a bog where they collected algae, worms, lizards, and bullfrogs for their terrariums and things to inspect under their microscopes.<br><br>Word that the family was moving to Berlin, more than three hundred kilometers from Breslau, came as a surprise to the children and elicited grumbling in the ranks. In 1912, the year Dietrich turned six, Dr. Karl Bonhoeffer was offered the chair of neurology and psychology at Friedrich-�Wilhelms-�University in Berlin, a prestigious post overseeing the clinic for nervous and psychiatric disorders. At Breslau, which had numbered Max Born, Erwin Schr�dinger, Fritz Haber, and Otto Stern among its many Nobel laureates, his position had been more than respectable. But Berlin offered greater prominence for Karl&#x2019;s clinical studies&#x2014;�along with a better salary and &#x201c;more possibilities&#x201d; for the children&#x2019;s development. And the metropolis of two million held great potential for cases of hysterics and addiction to study.<br><br>At first, the family rented a place on the Br�ckenallee, a street that no longer exists, near the Tiergarten, the former royal hunting estate that had become a public park, where Dietrich and Sabine might see the kaiser&#x2019;s children also at play. Four years later, Dr. Bonhoeffer purchased a three-�story Gr�nderzeit-�Villa in Grunewald. The suburb had been the brainchild of Otto von Bismarck, the first chancellor of the German empire, who set aside a large parcel of pristine forest to be developed as a residential district. A colony of grand country houses in a variety of architectural styles, Grunewald, or &#x201c;green forest,&#x201d; was the ideal rus in urbe, offering rural atmosphere within reach of urban amenities, while keeping the city&#x2019;s grittier aspects at bay. Scientists, statesmen, and scholars, filmmakers and movie stars, financiers and industrialists, all promenaded along the same leafy boulevards and mingled together at neighborhood soir�es. In the summer, canopies of linden and birch shaded the paved streets, and the woodlands to the south seemed to entwine the neighborhood&#x2019;s generously proportioned blocks. The writer Christopher Isherwood, who in the 1920s rented a flat in a noisy working-�class urban district, called Grunewald a &#x201c;millionaire&#x2019;s slum.&#x201d;<br><br>The Bonhoeffers warmed to their new home at 14 Wangenheimstrasse. Though smaller than their rented Breslau villa, the house was elegant and lean, built in the style of a classic German country home, with a hip, shingled roof, a bow front dormer, and a clinker brick face on the basement socle. There was also a deep yard, a large veranda facing the garden, and an office suite for Dr. Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s home clinic. On mild days, music drifting through the open windows could be heard in the garden of primroses and young bracken. &#x201c;An unobtrusive wealth and an uninhibited taste for pleasure and comfort,&#x201d; Bonhoeffer wrote in his unfinished autobiographical novel. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t so much the importance of the individual object that pleased the eye and warmed the heart as the solicitous care given to the whole.&#x201d;<br><br>Inside, the plain cedar floors, crafted to the highest German standards, were well worn. A &#x201c;thick, plaited mat covered the parquet floor&#x201d; in the front hall, there being no need, as the lady of the house, Paula Bonhoeffer, saw it, for children &#x201c;to run across Persian rugs before they knew how to keep their shoes clean.&#x201d; The appointments were simple and sturdy throughout, made to last of top-�quality wood and fittings. Beyond the foyer was an enormous living room (twenty meters wide, twenty-�five meters deep) that the Bonhoeffer family called simply das Zimmer, &#x201c;the room,&#x201d; or, if necessary, das grosse Zimmer, &#x201c;the big room,&#x201d; but never der Salon, the &#x201c;parlor,&#x201d; which to Paula&#x2019;s ear sounded pretentious. A massive dining table, the wood engraved on all sides, could comfortably seat a dozen in chairs of dark Bavarian timber. On the sideboard, Julie Tafel Bonhoeffer, the children&#x2019;s grandmother, who lived in T�bingen until moving to Berlin with her housekeeper in 1925, kept an antique silver box from which she occasionally drew pieces of chocolate to treat the little ones.<br><br>Family portraits and austere landscapes, many now hanging in Munich&#x2019;s Neue Pinakothek or in Hamburg&#x2019;s Kunsthalle, graced the spacious rooms downstairs. Some of the paintings were by Franz von Lenbach, the brothers Achenbach, and Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, but most were the work of Dietrich&#x2019;s great-�uncle, Leopold Graf von Kalckreuth, and his father, Stanislaus Graf von Kalckreuth. Of them all, Dietrich best liked the portrait of his great-�grandfather August von Hase, over a corner sofa. In the painting, the aging provost, for decades a distinguished professor of church at Jena, kneels before a crucifix, holding an empty hourglass.<br><br>With the help of a small army of servants&#x2014;�chambermaids, housekeepers, a cook and a gardener, a governess for each of the older children, a nurse for the small ones&#x2014;�Paula was praised for keeping a well-�tuned, comfortable, and stimulating home. After the move to Berlin a receptionist for Dr. Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s private clinic, housed in two side rooms off the main floor, was also hired, as well as a chauffeur.<br><br>The earliest German descendants of the Dutch clan van den Boenhoff left Nijmegen in 1513, settling in Schw�bisch Hall as goldsmiths, aldermen, and landowners. On the family seal a lion clutches some beans, against a blue field. Roughly translated, &#x201c;Boenhoff&#x201d; means &#x201c;beanfield.&#x201d; But by the nineteenth century, the family had achieved prominence in law, medicine, and the Lutheran Church.<br><br>Karl Bonhoeffer was the son of Judge Friedrich Ernst Philipp Tobias Bonhoeffer, a lawyer who served most of his life as president of the provincial court in Ulm. A contrary and emotionally distant man, he was a &#x201c;firm enemy of everything faddish and unnatural.&#x201d; He abhorred buses and trains, remaining convinced that any journey of less than sixty kilometers was better undertaken on foot, when all the transfers and inevitable delays were factored in. This meant that, for holiday visits, Karl and his siblings would have to walk the forty kilometers from T�bingen to their grandparents&#x2019; home in Stuttgart. Each spring the judge trekked alone through the Swabian Alps with a burlap bag of radish seeds, which he scattered Johnny Appleseed style, returning in the autumn to collect the harvest.<br><br>Karl Bonhoeffer inherited his father&#x2019;s exactitude and his aloofness, though not, it appears, his short temper. Outwardly gentler than the judge, Karl nevertheless demanded as much of his children as of himself. This was especially so of the way the children formulated their thoughts and expressed themselves. He expected precise and measured judgments, brooking no &#x201c;spontaneous utterances&#x201d; or banter in his home. Any child with something to say in the presence of adults had better choose his words carefully. Not that Karl was uninterested in his children&#x2019;s opinions; rather, he took pleasure in clarity of argument. A word spoken in haste or a half-�baked thought made him visibly unhappy. He could bring a child to attention by asking, &#x201c;Was sagst du?&#x201d;&#x2014;�&#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d; He may never have raised his voice, but he rarely embraced or kissed his children.<br><br>Karl subscribed to an enlightened skepticism toward the miraculous and the supernatural, toward any belief that contradicted the laws of reason. He accepted his wife&#x2019;s instructing the children in religion only in measured doses, and so long as it served a useful purpose. Nearly two decades of clinical work in empirical psychiatry and neurology had inclined him to think of religion as a tool that might sometimes help people order their lives and ward off chaos&#x2014;�although he felt there were better alternatives. He chose not to accompany his wife and younger children to the Lutheran Church of Grunewald they attended now and then, and he steered clear of the Sunday-�afternoon social hours that Paula convened over coffee and cake, with hymns sung around the piano. The twins&#x2019; religious formation was of more importance to their mother than that of the older children, perhaps because of her awareness of the boy&#x2019;s spiritual predilections. Karl Bonhoeffer did not oppose baptisms and confirmations&#x2014;�if they included a celebration in a spring garden, he rather enjoyed them&#x2014;�but he preferred to keep the Sabbath in his own way. It was his custom, after the evening meal, to gather the family in the library and read aloud stories, poems, and letters. Theodor Fontane and Friedrich Schiller were his favorites, though he also read from Fyodor Dostoevsky, Hermann Hesse, and Fritz Reuter, the popular nineteenth-�century chronicler of rural life. This was much more intellectually satisfying than religion, or psychoanalysis, which he criticized forthrightly for encouraging the same sort of meandering speech and speculative indulgences he found so insufferable. &#x201c;I understand nothing of that,&#x201d; he once said with a sigh after his wife had read the Advent story from the Gospel of Luke. He was only too happy to delegate stories of angels and virgin births to her capable care.<br><br>Paula Bonhoeffer was the daughter of Karl Alfred von Hase and Clara Gr�fin von Hase, n�e Countess Kalckreuth. Karl Alfred had been chaplain to the emperor at the Potsdam Garrison Church, and his father, the aforementioned nineteenth-�century church historian of some distinction. Paula&#x2019;s blue eyes, blond hair, and open, confident face set a striking contrast to her husband&#x2019;s pursed lips and melancholy eyes.</p><h2>Down Cut Shin Creek: The Pack Horse Librarians of Kentucky</h2><p>It's 4:30 in the morning, and the "book woman" and her horse are already on their way.

The first translations of Hindu texts found their way into the libraries of John Adams and Ralph Waldo Emerson. From there the ideas spread to Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and succeeding generations of receptive Americans, who absorbed India&#x2019;s &#x201c;science of consciousness&#x201d; and wove it into the fabric of their lives. Charismatic teachers like Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda came west in waves, prompting leading intellectuals, artists, and scientists such as Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, Allen Ginsberg, J. D. Salinger, John Coltrane, Dean Ornish, and Richard Alpert, aka Ram Dass, to adapt and disseminate what they learned from them. The impact has been enormous, enlarging our current understanding of the mind and body and dramatically changing how we view ourselves and our place in the cosmos. <br>&nbsp;<br>Goldberg paints a compelling picture of this remarkable East-to-West transmission, showing how it accelerated through the decades and eventually moved from the counterculture into our laboratories, libraries, and living rooms. Now physicians and therapists routinely recommend meditation, words like <i>karma </i>and <i>mantra </i>are part of our everyday vocabulary, and Yoga studios are as ubiquitous as Starbuckses. The insights of India&#x2019;s sages permeate so much of what we think, believe, and do that they have redefined the meaning of life for millions of Americans&#x2014;and continue to do so every day. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Rich in detail and expansive in scope, <i>American Veda</i> shows how we have come to accept and live by the central teaching of Vedic wisdom: &#x201c;Truth is one, the wise call it by many names.&#x201d;</p><p>PHILIP GOLDBERG is the author or coauthor of a number of books, including <i>Roadsigns: On the Spiritual Path </i>and <i>The Intuitive Edge. </i>Based in Los Angeles, he is an ordained interfaith minister, a public speaker and seminar leader, and cohost of the Spirit Matters podcast.

Easy to read it shines a light of understanding on the American Vedic Hindu path which started with the transference of knowledge from India, and equally important by its acceptance by the Americans of western orientation. It is a path on which now, the immigrant Vedic Hindu community and its progeny are grafting on to and traveling along with many in the mainstream community, resulting in, we hope increased understanding.

Since 1974, Boynton has written and illustrated over sixty children's books and seven general audience books, including five <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. More than 70 million of her books have been sold, "mostly to friends and family," she says. She has also written (with Michael Ford) and produced six albums of renegade children's music. Three of her albums have been certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold), and <i>Philadelphia Chickens</i>, nominated for a Grammy, has gone Platinum (over 1 million copies sold). Boynton has also directed twelve music videos of her songs, including the award-winning "One Shoe Blues" starring B.B. King, "Alligator Stroll" starring Josh Turner, and "Tyrannosaurus Funk" (animation) sung by Samuel L. Jackson. She lives in rural New England, and her studio is in a barn with perhaps the only hippopotamus weathervane in America.<br><br> &nbsp;PreS-K&#x2014;The chickens know that something odd is going on. A duck wearing gigantic monster feet? Pumpkins with eerie faces? Their anxiety mounts until a friend pops up to reassure them: "Relax, silly chickens! It's Halloween." This bite-size board book is infused with the sense of whimsy that fans of the author's work have grown to appreciate. She pairs readable text in verse with winsome, thick-lined, round-eyed illustrations to create a delightful introduction to this potentially frightening holiday. Readers will love the cast of enticing creatures&#x2014;a pig wearing a chicken suit, a large elephant in a mouse costume, a pair of grinning felines in wizard and witch hats, and the soft-bellied chickens (an endearingly expressive bunch, looking around uncertainly and grimacing forlornly)&#x2014;each placed against a simple backdrop. Boynton maintains a slightly eerie mood but keeps everything just gentle enough to appeal to the intended audience. VERDICT A great addition to board book collections, especially where Halloween titles are needed. Kids anticipating their first Halloween will be easily convinced, along with the initially nervous poultry, that the upcoming holiday is full of spooky fun.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>If God, Why Evil?: A New Way to Think About the Question</h2><p>Bestselling author and apologist takes on one of the most difficult questions Christians face.

And Why Doesn't God Do Something About It? <br><br>The problem of evil is perhaps the most difficult question the Christian must face.

"And how does it feel to be back in Number One Main Street, Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly?" Three honeymoon weeks in Rhodes had given them both healthy glows and brightened the silver streaks in the raven hair of Caitlin "Kitty" O&#x2019;Reilly n�e O&#x2019;Hallorhan. <br> <br>"It feels very good to be home, Fingal, and in what&#x2019;s now my home, too," she said, stretching out a hand and covering his. <br> <br>"And it does be good to have you both back, so."

"Now eat up however little much is in it, Miss&#x2014;" She frowned. <br> <br>Oh-oh, Fingal thought, Kinky&#x2019;s having difficulty working out the proper form of address between the housekeeper and the mistress of the house.

I&#x2019;ve done the rashers crisp, the way you like them." <br> <br>The telephone in the hall began its double-ringing clamour. "I&#x2019;ll see who that is," she said. <br> <br>"That was gracious, Kitty," O&#x2019;Reilly said, feeling his mouth water, "and it&#x2019;s a great relief to me that you and Kinky are getting on so well now." He stabbed a ring of black pudding, sliced it, and shoved half into his mouth. Greek grub had been all right, but it was great to get back to Kinky&#x2019;s proper Irish cooking. He was, as she often remarked, "a grand man for the pan." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d better," Kitty said, and smiled. "It&#x2019;ll be a whole new experience for you, having three women in the house and no fun at all if two of them are at loggerheads." <br> <br>"True enough." Young Barry Laverty, who had been O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s assistant until recently, had gone to Ballymena for training in obstetrics and gynaecology. His place as temporary assistant had been taken by one Doctor Jennifer Bradley, who was out on a maternity case this Saturday morning. "At least," he said, "having Jenny living and working here lets me have some weekends off. After breakfast, let&#x2019;s pop in and see Donal and Julie Donnelly and the new chissler. Kinky tells me the wee lass arrived three days after we left, so her birthday&#x2019;s July 6." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;ll put that in my diary when we&#x2019;ve finished breakfast&#x2014;" <br> <br>"Sir." Kinky stood in the doorway. The colour had left her cheeks. "It&#x2019;s the marquis. His sister, Lady MacNeill, has had a riding accident." <br> <br>Fingal ran to the phone, bolting the black pudding as he did. Young ones being born, middle-aged ones falling off their bloody horses. The daily round of the country G.P., a job he&#x2019;d loved for more than twenty years. And he was duty bound to answer this call even if it was his weekend off. He grabbed the receiver. "John? What&#x2019;s up?" <br> <br>He listened as John MacNeill, marquis of Ballybucklebo, explained how his sister had been thrown when her gelding, Bramble, balked at a jump. "You reckon her leg&#x2019;s bust? I see. Is she conscious? Good. No trouble breathing? Good. John, don&#x2019;t try to move her. Keep her warm, don&#x2019;t give her anything to eat or drink, and I&#x2019;ll be right out." He slammed the receiver into its cradle. "Kinky, get an ambulance out to Ballybucklebo House." He stuck his head into the dining room. "Kitty, the marquis&#x2019;s sister has been hurt. I&#x2019;m heading straight out there. Shouldn&#x2019;t be too long." <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m coming&#x2014;" Kitty started to rise. <br> <br>"Finish your breakfast." There was no time to waste on politeness or explanations. He had to get out there now, and even if she was a nurse, there was nothing Kitty could do. As he crossed the hall, O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s stomach grumbled. Couldn&#x2019;t be helped, but Lord, that soup�on of black pudding had been delicious. He grabbed his bag from the surgery and charged down the hall. Lady Macbeth, his white cat, leapt for the stairs, scrabbled between the bars of the banister, arched her back, fluffed her tail, and spat. <br> <br>He raced through the back garden yelling, "Stay, Arthur," when the big black Labrador stuck his muzzle out of his kennel. <br> <br>In moments O&#x2019;Reilly was in the long-nosed Rover, roaring along the main Belfast to Bangor Road. He barely noticed a cyclist taking refuge in the ditch. Up the gravelled drive, past the oddly shaped topiary in front of Ballybucklebo House, round its Virginia-creeper-covered gable end. The gate was open to an adjoining paddock, where he saw a saddled bay horse, reins dangling, cropping the grass. Two men squatted beside a figure lying near a two-bar jump. <br> <br>The old Rover jounced across the field, shuddered to a halt, and O&#x2019;Reilly, bag in hand, dismounted close to the marquis and his butler/valet Thompson. Both were coatless, their jackets covering the prone Myrna even though the sun was splitting the heavens. Fingal felt its early-morning heat and heard the burbling of wood pigeons from a nearby coppice and the <i>Kek-kek-kek</i> of a cock pheasant. <br> <br>"Fingal," John O&#x2019;Neill said. "Thank you so much for coming so quickly. Thompson and I have done as you told us." <br> <br>"Good." He knelt. "Myrna, please don&#x2019;t turn your head, but can you hear me?" <br> <br>Until he was satisfied that she hadn&#x2019;t hurt her spine it was critical that Myrna not move. <br> <br>"I can hear you perfectly clearly, Fingal, thank you." <br> <br>"Where are you sore?" <br> <br>"I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll have a bruise like a soup plate on my backside, but it&#x2019;s my right thigh. I distinctly heard the bone snap. It&#x2019;s aching now to beat Bannagher and I can feel the muscles all knotted up." He was impressed by how calm she sounded describing what was, almost certainly, the muscle spasms associated with fractures of the femoral shaft. "And no, I didn&#x2019;t land on my head." He noticed that her John Bull top hat was still firmly in place. "I was getting ready for next week&#x2019;s gymkhana. Bloody horse has never refused before and I should be putting him at the jump again, but clearly I&#x2019;m not fit to do that." <br> <br>"Lie still, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said. <br> <br>"I wonder, Thompson, if you&#x2019;d be good enough to catch Bramble?" said the marquis. "Take him back to the stables." He spoke to his sister. "I don&#x2019;t want you fretting about your horse. Don&#x2019;t worry, Myrna. I&#x2019;ll get him over that damned jump once I know you&#x2019;re settled." <br> <br>"Thank you, John." <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly ran through the routine assessment of a patient who had fallen. When he examined her lower limbs, he had already satisfied himself that she had suffered no head or spinal cord injury at least as far down as the first lumbar vertebra, and if she was feeling pain in her thigh and could sense the spasms, it was probable that the second and third were unaffected too. The fuller neurological assessment could wait until she was in the hands of the orthopaedic specialists at the Musgrave and Clark Clinic, the private hospital associated with the Royal Victoria Hospital. Right now, he had no concerns about moving Myrna once her leg had been splinted. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly glanced at his watch. "I&#x2019;ve sent for an ambulance," he said. "Should be at the hall soon. Could you meet them, John? Bring them round here." <br> <br>"Of course." The marquis left. <br> <br>"I need to have a look at the leg, Myrna," O&#x2019;Reilly said, not relishing what he had to do. <br> <br>"Go ahead, Doctor." She smiled, then winced. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly looked at her right riding boot. The toes were pointing to the side at an unnatural angle and the whole leg seemed to be about an inch shorter than the left. He took a deep breath and gently laid both hands on her jodhpurs at the top of her right thigh. When he approached mid-thigh he heard Myrna sucking in her breath. "Sorry," he said. <br> <br>"That bloody well hurt." He saw how pale she was and a drop of blood where she had bitten her lip. <br> <br>O&#x2019;Reilly was certain Myrna had fractured the shaft of her right femur. "Your diagnosis is correct, I&#x2019;m afraid," he said. "It is broken. We&#x2019;ll have to get you to the Clinic and have it set. In fact, I think I hear the ambulance arriving now. I&#x2019;ll give you something for the pain." <br> <br>The ambulance driver and attendant were efficient, waited patiently until the quarter grain of morphine he had given her took effect before they applied a Thomas traction splint to immobilise the break, realign the ends of the broken bone, and reduce muscle spasm and further soft tissue injury. Introduced by the Welsh surgeon Hugh Owen Thomas in 1916, this type of splint had reduced the mortality rate for femoral shaft fractures from 80 to 8 percent. <br> <br>The ambulance driver tied a label to her hacking jacket collar. The red "M" indicated she&#x2019;d been given morphine. <br> <br>She said drowsily, "Thank you, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly," as they loaded her into the primrose yellow Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority ambulance. It drove off, slowly at first, across the irregular ground in the field. The injury, now the splint had been applied, was hardly life-threatening, so there were no accompanying flashing lights or screaming sirens. <br> <br>"She&#x2019;ll be grand, John," O&#x2019;Reilly said to the marquis. "As good as new. Broken bones are pretty routine stuff today." Not, he thought, like in my student and junior doctor days. Fingal decided not to worry the marquis by talking about potential complications like nonunion of the bones or deep venous thrombosis in an immobilised limb. <br> <br>"I appreciate your coming out, Fingal, and your reassurance," the marquis said, "and I&#x2019;m sure she will be fine. Myrna&#x2019;s a tough old bird." He nodded toward the house. "I suppose it&#x2019;s a bit early for a Jameson, but if you&#x2019;d like a cuppa?" <br> <br>"Much too early for whiskey," said Fingal, "and as I hadn&#x2019;t even finished my breakfast. I&#x2019;ll be trotting on, thank you, John." He opened the car&#x2019;s door and chucked his bag inside. <br> <br>"Understood," said the marquis, stooping to retrieve his and Thompson&#x2019;s coats, "but now you&#x2019;re home from abroad you and Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly must come round soon. Have a bite." <br> <br>"We&#x2019;d like that," O&#x2019;Reilly said, thinking how much he liked the "we," "but it&#x2019;s home James, and don&#x2019;t spare the horses for me now." <br> <br>On the drive back to Number One, O&#x2019;Reilly let his thoughts roam. He&#x2019;d phone and arrange for Myrna MacNeill to be looked after by Sir Donald Cromie, one of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s classmates and close friends from their student days in Dublin. Cromie&#x2019;d studied under Mister Jimmy Withers, the first orthopaedic surgeon in Northern Ireland. Fingal&#x2019;s other great friend, Charlie Greer, was now a consultant neurosurgeon at the Royal Victoria. <br> <br>It had been an interesting road Fingal O&#x2019;Reilly had travelled to get here; G.P. in Dublin, junior doctor in the Rotunda Maternity Hospital there, then assistant to Doctor Flanagan here in Ballybucklebo before the war. He&#x2019;d been briefly married when he was a naval surgeon on a British battleship, and then after the war the widowed principal in his present practice. He frowned. The first years here had been lonely ones without her, but Fingal was single no more and he knew his first wife Deirdre would fully approve of Kitty, and that thought drove away his frown and brought a smile to the dark eyes he&#x2019;d inherited from his father. <br> <br>He could recall in detail his interview for that very first job, and his first-ever case as a newly qualified doctor. That had been a patient with a fracture too, but unlike today, in 1936 the outlook was not as good. <br> <br>It took no effort to see himself twenty-seven, one week qualified, standing in Aungier Place in Dublin&#x2019;s Liberties slums ready to go into the building that housed the dispensary practice presided over by one Doctor Phelim Corrigan. <br> <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ballybucklebo Stories Corp <br> <p></p></p><h2>Queen of Hearts (Queen of Hearts, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The first novel in Colleen Oakes&#x2019;s epic, imaginative and twisted series, perfect for fans of <em>Dorothy Must Die</em> and <em>Heartless</em>, tackles the origin of one of the most infamous villains&#x2014;the Queen of Hearts.</strong> </p><p>This is not the story of the Wonderland we know.

With their tricked-out shoes and their formidable technique they performed marvels on full pointe: endless balances, dazzling pirouettes, even an unheard-of thirty-two fouett�s. Pavlova toiled to make herself into a virtuosa in their mold. </p><p> Fortunately her teacher Pavel Gerdt advised her to leave off the tricks and turns and focus on developing her own innate qualities: delicacy, lyricism, expressivity. In the end Pavlova triumphed as a Romantic dancer at a time when hard-boiled classicism was all the rage, and she went on to foment balletomania the world over. Of course, she never stopped working on her technique; she even got the greatest Italian ballet master of all, Enrico Cecchetti, to give private lessons to her and no one else. And she did adopt the newfangled Italian shoes (albeit doctored in her secret way), but not just for flash or bravura. Pavlova did the opposite: she used pointework to convey achingly beautiful vulnerability. </p><p> Pavlova became a legend by tapping into her genius for self-expression rather than by technique alone. She cultivated her own eloquent "voice." And you can do the same even if you never set foot on a stage. Certainly executing steps well provides tremendous satisfaction. But ballet's joy lies not just in doing steps; it's in <i>dancing</i> them -- in the pleasure of expression through movement, of union with music, of singing with your body. I hope this book helps you not only in developing proficiency but also in discovering your voice. </p><p> <i>The Ballet Companion</i> offers a discussion of technique that is not just how to, but why. You already know what tendus are because you do them in class. But you may not realize why you do so many, or that the meaning of the word in French ("stretched") defines the quality of the movement, or that a famous choreographic passage, the opening of Balanchine's <i>Theme and Variations,</i> is based on them -- or how by perfecting your tendu you can improve your technique overall. Throughout the book, I connect the work you do in class to the bigger picture. </p><p> That picture, of course, includes performance. Looking as much as doing sparked my own love of ballet. My Wrst impressions were formed watching Fonteyn and Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Fracci, Makarova in <i>Swan Lake,</i> Kirkland in <i>Giselle,</i> and the opening night (a school night at that) of Balanchine's 1972 Stravinsky Festival with its landmark premieres. Granted, that's a hard act to follow, but every generation has its own superb dancers. Let today's inspire you. </p><p> In the back of this book you will find a collection of choreographic "greatest hits" along with some of my favorites that are less well known. Go to the ballet as often as you can. If you can see a work repeatedly, that's even better. A second or third viewing reveals the craftsmanship in the choreography and lets you compare different interpretations. In deciding what you admire and what you don't, what you allow to influence you and what you reject, you will shape your own character as a dancer. </p><p> Sometimes the first step toward finding your voice is to realize that it's okay to have one. This book is generously sprinkled with nuggets of ballet history that show how often a distinctive choreographic or performing personality has influenced and enriched ballet. Things we take for granted today -- the one-act ballet, the tutu, the overhead lift, the blocked pointe shoe, even women dancing professionally -- all were innovations in their time and sometimes bitterly resisted. Dance history is full of skirmishes between rebels and traditionalists, but ultimately dance embraces new voices and rewards those who take risks. </p><p> As a student I was captivated by ballet history and contrived to write every school term paper I could on a ballet subject. An assignment on great Americans became an essay on Ted Shawn, an art history project a study of Diaghilev's collaborations. My poor logic professor asked for an example of a well-constructed argument and got a scathing critique of the dance program at Yale. I took great pleasure in using my obsession with dance as a means of enlivening schoolwork; you might, too. </p><p> Ballet history is delicious -- it's rich and glamorous and fun. It's also important for your dancing in a serious way. You develop an informed artistry when you understand why the Sylph holds her arms differently from the Sugar Plum Fairy, or why a Bournonville allegro must bounce along the way it does. Petipa and Ivanov's <i>Swan Lake</i> and Fokine's <i>Dying Swan</i> were choreographed only ten years apart and both feature swan-women in white, feathered tutus. But to dance Fokine like Petipa would be to miss the point. Fokine loathed -- among other things -- classicism's stale verticality and lack of expressivity, so his reforms included a liberation of the arms and upper body. This isn't a stylistic nicety; it's a wholly different approach. We know about it from history: from his own manifesto and from the accounts of the dancers he trained. </p><p> I hope the historical tidbits in this book intrigue you enough so that you read more. Dancers' autobiographies are often delightful and engrossing. It's fascinating to read about your own familiar exercises and routines as they were in other times: in Imperial Russia or with the Ballets Russes or under Communism or for Balanchine. Some of the dancers' stories will surely resonate with you and contribute to the creation of your own dancing personality. </p><p> Ballet training rightly focuses on technique and artistry, but dancers are not indestructible, and they ignore their health at their peril. Ballet has become more overtly athletic. Although dancers still pretend not to sweat on stage, and still conceal their exertions under serene smiles, their bodies are being pushed and pulled as never before. Fortunately, there is now far more awareness and knowledge of dancers' health. </p><p> A whole new field of medicine has sprung up, and its practitioners have much to offer on the subject of injury prevention and safe training. Eating disorders, once a shameful secret, are now brought into the sunlight for compassionate confrontation and cure. Cross training is widely recognized as a complement to class that can speed the process of building strength and flexibility. I have devoted an extensive section of this book to the healthy dancer. </p><p> Like a strong and flexible dancer, ballet itself is hardy. It phoenixed out of the aristocratic pomp of the Baroque age. Powdered wigs and snuff boxes are long gone, but ballet has endured and maintained its traditions -- vestiges of its royal origins -- while resiliently absorbing new ideas. From a boys-only club to the cult of the ballerina, from six-foot hoop skirts to nudity, from courtiers elaborately curtsying to the king to performances that incite antigovernment protest, throughout its rich history ballet has repeatedly remodeled itself and survived. </p><p> So go ahead: cultivate your technique, your voice, and your ideas. No great choreographer ever picked a boring dancer for a muse. Ballet needs distinctive personalities to inspire new choreographic genius, to make the classics fresh, and to keep the audience interested. Your self-expression may lead you beyond ballet to other forms of dance, or to the theater. You may become a choreographer, dance teacher, dance historian, dance doctor, dance critic, dance notator, dance photographer, dance administrator or, as I did, a pointe shoe designer. You may decide to be the next Martha Graham and invent a whole new dance language. In all these endeavors your ballet technique, along with your knowledge of ballet's traditions, is the foundation on which you build. And even in nondance pursuits, qualities you develop in the studio -- physical intelligence and confidence in your own voice -- will serve you very well outside it. I hope this book helps you in joyfully creating your foundation. I hope it encourages you to soar. </p><p> <b></b></p><b> Part One: To Be a Dancer </b> <p> <b>Getting Started</b> </p><p> <b>Selecting a Ballet School</b> </p><p> Your mother says you danced in the crib. You love moving to music. Perhaps you want to perform. Perhaps performing is not for you, but the exhilaration of a well-executed tour jet� in class is. Perhaps you've been advised to try it for medical reasons, to make you strong or improve your posture. Or maybe, like Alexandra Ansanelli, principal dancer at the New York City Ballet, you were knocked out cold on the soccer Weld and your parents wanted you in something safer. Whatever draws you to ballet, finding the right school will make all the diVerence to your experience. </p><p> In the United States anyone can hang out a shingle and call him - or herself a ballet teacher. There is no organization or governing body to license teachers and maintain standards. But there are many indicators of a school's merits. Here are some things to look for when considering where to study, many of which are described in more detail later in this book: </p><p> </p><ol> <li><b>Teacher's Credentials</b></li> <p> The instructor with the most glamorous and prestigious performing credentials may not be the best teacher. The ability to dance brilliantly is different from the skills that make a great teacher: the ability to analyze, to break down steps, to explain, to inspire. Some people possess both performing and teaching abilities; some don't. </p><p> In France no one is allowed to teach without a state diploma. In the United States, the Cecchetti Society, the Cecchetti Council of America, and the London-based Royal Academy of Dance (R.A.D.) are highly respected institutions whose founders cared deeply about how ballet is taught. Teachers who have been trained through these organizations have learned a well-established syllabus -- a known commodity with a proven track record of providing safe, solid, classical training. These are by no means the only good choices. There are other major training systems (see...</p></ol></p><h2>Interim Ministry in Action: A Handbook for Churches in Transition</h2><p>Many churches today find themselves in frequent transition, whether due to the changing culture, the struggles of mainline churches, or the changing nature of mission. Interim Ministry in Action helps guide churches and their leadership through these times of change. The book will guide readers step-by-step through the process of how and why to decide to call an interim minister, the process for deciding what&#x2019;s next, and more. Each chapter concludes with exercises for readers, search committees, or boards to illustrate key themes and help them determine the best path forward.</p><p>Norman B. Bendroth is a professional transitional specialist trained by the Interim Ministry Network and serves on their faculty. He has served as a settled pastor in two United Church of Christ congregations and as an interim minister in ten others. He is the author of Transitional Ministry Today: Successful Strategies for Churches and Pastors and is a board certified coach and church consultant.When a pastor departs after a short or long tenure, a unique season of possibilities opens up for a congregation. Based on his own extensive experience in leading congregations through the interim season and educating transitional pastors, Norman Bendroth offers insight and inspiration for navigating those possibilities from the best of current wisdom. (David R. Sawyer, Flourishing Church Consulting and Coaching; retired professor of ministry, Louisville Presbyterian Seminary; author of Pathmarks to New Church: A Workbook for Leaders of Communities in Search of Innovation)<br><br>This marvelous resource reaches deeply into the actual practice of transition ministry and delineates the What, the How, the When, and especially the Why in a marvelously accessible manner. This work will be of enormous benefit to lay and ordained leaders and their congregations for many years to come. (John F.

An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was his most important book. First published in London in March 1776, it had been eagerly anticipated by Smith&#39;s contemporaries and became an immediate bestseller. That edition sold out quickly and others followed. Today, Smith&#39;s Wealth of Nations rightfully claims a place in the Western intellectual canon. It is the first book of modern political economy, and still provides the foundation for the study of that discipline. But it is much more than that. Along with important discussions of economics and political theory, Smith mixed plain common sense with large measures of history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and much else. Few texts remind us so clearly that the Enlightenment was very much a lived experience, a concern with improving the human condition in practical ways for real people. A masterpiece by any measure, Wealth of Nations remains a classic of world literature to be usefully enjoyed by readers today.</p><p>Adam Smith (1723-1790) was a Scottish historian, political economist, writer, rhetorician, astronomer, and social philosopher, who wrote &#39;The Wealth of Nations&#39;.

Some faithful readers struggle through its pages and conclude that they must obey its moral laws but may disregard its ceremonial and civil laws. Others abandon its teaching altogether in favor of a strictly New Testament ethic. Neither option, argues Chris Wright, gives the Old Testament its due. In this innovative approach to Old Testament ethics--fully revised, updated and expanded since its first appearance in 1983 as <em>Living as the People of God</em> (<em>An Eye for an Eye</em> in North America) and including material from <em>Walking in the Ways of the Lord</em>--Wright examines a theological, social and economic framework for Old Testament ethics. Then he explores a variety of themes in relation to contemporary issues: economics, the land and the poor; politics and a world of nations; law and justice; society and culture; and the way of the individual. This fresh, illuminating study provides a clear basis for a biblical ethic that is faithful to the God of both Testaments.</p><p><strong>Christopher J. H. Wright</strong> is international director of the Langham Partnership International. Formerly principal of All Nations Christian College, he is the author of several books, including <em>Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament, The Mission of God: Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative,</em> and commentaries on Deuteronomy and Ezekiel."Whether Wright's conclusions become the consensus opinion of the next generation obviously remains to bge seen, but I can't imagine future discussion of the issue ignoring the well-thought out arguments laid out in this book." (Phil Sumpter, Chrisendom, August 22, 2008)<br><br>"This is a wonderful book by an impressive scholar of the 1st Testament. In a culture that often cares little about social justice, the poor, and/or personal financial ethics, this book gives us a sobering look into the social requirements that God expected his people live by in the Old Testament. It is always a treat to find an author who has a great combination of scholarship and writing skill. I believe Christopher Wright is one such author, who has found a way to make his wonderful scholarship both informative and a joy to read. I would highly recommend this book." (On Thoughts From a Young, Slightly Cantankerous, Aspiring Theologian blog, February 3, 2008)<br><br>?Wright has fully revised and updated his two earlier books on Old Testament ethics, and has integrated them into one edition. The result is his fullest expression of the fruit of many years of reflection and study on the authority and relevance of Old Testament Scripture to Christian ethics." (Evangelical Review of Theology, July 2007)<br><br>"Remarkably balanced, sensitive, and thorough . . . A fine resource not only for the educator, but also for the pastor." (Missiology, January 2006)<br><br>"After thirty years' research and writing on Old Testament ethics, Chris Wright has brought his conclusions together in this comprehensive and readable textbook. It is truly a <em>magnum opus</em> and should be at the top of the reading list for any student, teacher, minister or layperson interested in the relevance of the first part of the Bible to modern ethical issues." (David L. Baker, Tyndale House, Cambridge)<br><br>"Chris Wright has been one of the most significant writers on Old Testament ethics over recent decades. In a unique way he combines commitment to listening openly to the Old Testament as Scripture, reflectiveness over questions of method, and clarity as a writer. It is excellent that he has been able to stand back and rework so much of his important work into this definitive volume."

It is an investigation that will lead him to walk a fine line between personal loyalty and professional honor. What brought Eugenie Davies to London on a rainy autumn night? Why was she carrying the name of the man who found her body? Could her murder have some connection to a 28-year-old musical wunderkind, a virtuoso violinist whose talents have been internationally renowned since he was ten? To answer these questions Lynley will put his career in jeopardy even as he tries to safeguard those of his longtime partners Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata. Together, they must untangle the dark secrets and darker passions of a family whose history conceals the truth behind a horrific crime.</p><p>Families can be monstrous and their secrets dangerous, as New Scotland Yard detectives Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers have discovered. The pair are puzzled that the Hampstead police need their help investigating the vehicular murder of a middle-aged divorc�e, until they find evidence that one of their own superiors once knew the dead lady very well indeed. But the circumstances of Eugenie Davies's murder appear to center on her children: Gideon, a famous violinist now undergoing psychoanalysis for his sudden inability to play, and the long-dead Sonia, a disabled baby whose drowning death was shrouded in secrecy for her virtuoso brother's sake--at the insistence of their father, Richard--but also trumpeted in the press as the infamous "nanny murder" of its day. The nanny, Katja Wolff, has recently been released from prison, having never spoken of the night Sonia drowned. Lynley, Havers, and their colleague Winston Nkata know that whatever secret Katja Wolff has been hiding must be the cause of Eugenie Davies's death, but before they can find out what it is, another deliberate hit-and-run occurs in their own backyard.<p> The suspects are many: Wolff; Eugenie's most recent suitor; her ne'er-do-well brother; Gideon's longtime mentor, who kept in contact with Eugenie in the years after she abandoned her husband and son; and a gentleman of many monikers who boarded with the family at the time of the drowning. Even Richard Davies, the dead woman's ex-husband, is under suspicion. But it's violinist Gideon Davies's quest into his family's past, undertaken to save his career, that sets the book's events in motion. His own telling of the story runs parallel to the author's own voice but is time-shifted. Along with the details of the police investigation, this paints a disturbing picture of what happens when the truth is obscured and a child's normal instincts sublimated.</p><p> <i>A Traitor to Memory</i> is massive, and it's hard <i>not</i> to spot a few flaws in a plot so complex. The dual narratives force abnormally slow reading, the motive for one murder and two near-murders is inexplicably glossed over, and many doughty Lynley/Havers fans will still wonder by the end what exactly happened in Sonia's bathroom. Yet Elizabeth George orchestrates the family-secrets theme like a maestro, and at least one of the second-chair players--such as Katja Wolff's beautiful, scarred lover Yasmine Edwards--may be a rising star in the series. George's fans will no doubt find this 11th entry in the series worthy of a standing ovation. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>"This can only add to her growing reputation as doyenne of English mystery novelists. ...

How do you mine them for the craft lessons you want your students to learn?<br> In <i>Craft Moves</i>, Stacey Shubitz, cofounder of the Two Writing Teachers website, does the heavy lifting for you: using twenty recently published picture books, she creates more than 180 lessons to teach various craft moves that will help your students become better writers.<br> Stacey first discusses picture books as teaching tools and offers ways to integrate them into your curriculum, and classroom discussions. She also shares routines and classroom procedures to help students focus on their writing during the independent writing portion of writing workshop and helps teachers prepare for small-group instruction.<br> Each of the 184 lessons in the book includes a publisher&#x2019;s summary, a rationale or explanation of the craft move demonstrated in the book, and a procedure that takes teachers and students back into the mentor text to deepen their understanding of the selected craft move. A step-by-step guide demonstrates how to analyze a picture book for multiple craft moves.<br> Using picture books as mentor texts will help your students not only read as writers and write with joy but also become writers who can effectively communicate meaning, structure their writing, write with detail, and give their writing their own unique voice.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>For the past fifteen years, Stacey has worked with writers and teachers of writers, inspiring them with the power of writing workshop. Stacey began her career in education teaching fifth grade at P.S. 171 in East Harlem, New York, and then fourth grade at The Learning Community, a public charter school in Central Falls, Rhode Island. Stacey now works as a literacy consultant and an adjunct professor. She is also the Chief&nbsp;of Operations&nbsp;and Lead Writer for&nbsp;Two Writing Teachers, a popular blog about the teaching of writing.</p><p>Stacey grew up in the New York Metropolitan Area and wanted to be a writer thanks to the inspiration of her first-grade teacher, Carol Snook, who used the writing workshop approach (in 1982) long before it was popular. She thought of becoming a teacher during college, but instead worked as an assistant editor for iVillage.com and did public relations for several small cosmetics companies. "With every press release I wrote, I realized my true calling was to work with children,&#x201d; she says. Stacey earned her M.S. Ed. degree from Hunter College of the City University of New York and a master's degree in literacy from Teachers College at Columbia University.</p><p>Stacey specializes in mentor texts, conferring, and the routines of writing workshop. Her passion is helping teachers develop a writing identity. "When I was a classroom teacher, I wanted my students to live like writers. I realized my students needed to see my writing, hear my thinking about writing, and understand my struggles as a writer if I was going to have credibility when I conferred with them,&#x201d; she says. &nbsp;Seeing as teachers are the living, breathing authors in the room, Stacey believes teachers must sit beside students, as writers, and talk about their writing process so young writers can understand why and how craft moves are made. &#x201c;Some teachers I&#x2019;ve worked with don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re good writers. They&#x2019;re paralyzed with fear because somewhere along the way they were made to feel afraid of writing. One of my greatest joys is helping teachers overcome their discomfort with writing so they can positively impact the lives of the children they teach by becoming a mentor author for their students.&#x201d;</p><p>Stacey&#x2019;s first Stenhouse book,&nbsp;<i>Day By Day: Refining Writing Workshop Through 180 Days of Reflective Practice</i>, co-authored with Ruth Ayres, provides teachers with daily encouragement, practical strategies, and advice to run an effective writing workshop that meets the needs of elementary writers. Her latest book,&nbsp;<i>Craft Moves: Lesson Sets for Teaching Writing with Mentor Texts</i>, includes&nbsp;more than 180 lessons to teach various craft moves found in children&#x2019;s picture books that will help K-5 students become better writers.</p><p>In her free time, Stacey cooks, swims, and practices Pilates. A beach-lover, she dreams of living and writing by the sea when she &#x201c;grows up.&#x201d; For the foreseeable future, she lives in Central Pennsylvania with her husband and daughter.</p>Craft Moves: Lesson Sets for Teaching Writing with Mentor Texts shows teachers how to select mentor texts for students and how to tie these texts into curriculum plans. It takes some twenty recently published picture books and creates nearly two hundred lessons from them that teach students how to become better writers, and it includes step-by-step assessments of how and why these books were chosen and used, and explains the craft moves in each book. Using picture books as mentor texts help students in various grades grow into more effective communicators. Having a book that tells exactly how this process can be used with these and other books gives teachers an important leg up in the process of selecting and using mentor texts.<br> James A. Cox<br> Editor-in-Chief<br> Midwest Book Review<br> &nbsp;<br><br>Craft Moves<i> is exactly what you&#x2019;d expect from Stacey Shubitz&#x2014;a book that&#x2019;s as thoughtful as it is practical. Stacey understands that there&#x2019;s no quick fix or formula for strong writing. It grows slowly and must be nourished by thoughtful teachers who bring powerful literature into the classroom. If you want to help your students improve the quality of their writing&#x2014;and who doesn&#x2019;t?&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll find </i>Craft Moves<i> a must-have resource.</i><br><i>Ralph Fletcher, author of </i>Making Nonfiction from Scratch<br><br>Craft Moves<i> is an enduring present to teachers&#x2014;a way to think about their writing classrooms and support their writers in a journey toward greater independence and success. Stacey Shubitz gives teachers a professional book about mentor text to serve as a springboard to inspire writers in K&#x2013;6 classrooms everywhere.</i><br><i>&#x2014;Lynne Dorfman, coauthor of </i>Grammar Matters<br><br>I tried to think about how to begin this book review, but every time I started to write, I couldn&#x2019;t find the words.<br> I tried words like &#x201c;Fabulous&#x201d; and &#x201c;Exciting,&#x201d; but they seemed inadequate to explain how powerful and important Stacey Shubitz&#x2019;s new book,&nbsp;<i>Craft Moves: Lesson Sets for Teaching Writing with Mentor Texts</i>, is to middle grades teachers and students everywhere.<br> As a life-long learner and &#x201c;forever in the making&#x201d; educator, I am always searching for books that help me become a better teacher. This is one I definitely recommend for the shelf where you keep your &#x201c;go-to book&#x201d; collection.<br> Finding the extra time to research and write original lessons to supplement&nbsp;Readers and Writers Workshop is not an easy thing to do. Luckily for teachers in grades 4 and 5, this book is a perfect Workshop accessory and definitely a time saver.<br> With clear, easy-to-follow instructions and many examples, Shubitz helps teachers discover the literary treasures that can be found in mentor books, specifically picture books.<br> The first three chapters provide insight into Shubitz&#x2019; journey as she wrote this book. They serve as an introduction to teachers who are unfamiliar with mentor texts and provide a refresher for teachers who currently use mentor texts as part of their Workshop classroom.<br> So...What are mentor texts?<br> Shubitz: &#x201c;Mentor texts are examples of exemplary writing we can study during writing workshops. Teacher use mentor texts to teach students how to lift the level of their writing.&#x201d; (Introduction, p. 3)<br> And she quotes Dorfman and Cappelli (2007): &#x201c;Mentor texts help writers notice things about the author&#x2019;s work that is not like anything they might have done before, and empower them to try something new.&#x201d;<br> To be honest, when I first learned about using mentor texts and close reading, I was baffled. How could I maintain student interest by using a text more than once? I certainly wasn&#x2019;t a believer in this &#x201c;new fangled&#x201d; approach. But I soon learned that giving students ownership of a mentor text gave them not only the models they needed but also the security of working with a familiar text.<br> Think about a movie that you love watching over and over again. I thought about the movie,&nbsp;<i>Airplane.</i>&nbsp;The first time that I saw the movie, I couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing. The next time I watched it, I found new scenes and dialogue that had me giggling. As I watch it again and again, I found other jokes and double meanings in the script that I had missed.<br> That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s like as we revisit mentor texts. Each time that you read them, you find new insights into the author&#x2019;s mind.<br> The first chapters of Shubitz&#x2019; book help us build a classroom environment where students will be able to grow as writers using the techniques and skills of published authors. As you read the book, you will hear Shubitz in her role as mentor.<br> In chapter one, she explains how to choose picture books that will meet your students&#x2019; needs in the future. In chapter two, she engages in a dialogue of how to integrate picture books into your curriculum and classroom conversations. Chapter three is an invaluable guide that focuses specifically on routines and procedures to have in place that will build independent writers. Chapter four centers on the how and when of small group instruction.<br> If you are new to using mentor texts, these introductory chapters will help you understand more about Readers and Writers Workshop.&nbsp;Even if you are an experienced teacher of Readers and Writers Workshop...please....please don&#x2019;t skip these important chapters and immediately delve into the strategy lessons. You will likely learn something new.<br> The fiction and nonfiction strategy lessons<br> Shubitz has chosen 20 high quality, current mirror books (books in which the readers can see themselves) and window books (books where the reader learns about others). The lessons can be adapted for small group instruction, whether as partnerships, small groups formed around students&#x2019; current needs, or individual one-on-one conferences. Bear in mind, this is not a scripted program. The strategies are suggestive, dependent on the skills your students need to develop. You will assess students&#x2019; needs before applying the suggested &#x201c;craft power moves.&#x201d;<br> Shubitz offers an ample supply of student samples and glimpses into classrooms where she has worked with various teachers as she researched and wrote this book.<br> Each of the 184 lessons...(Yes, 184 lessons!) in the book includes a publisher&#x2019;s summary, an explanation of the craft move, and a systematic guide. As with Reader and Writers Workshop, the lessons follow the format of the Teachers College recommended instruction: Demonstration, Guided Practice, Explanation and Example, and Inquiry.<br> Recalling our purpose<br> Sometimes we become so bogged down with assessments and standardized testing that we forget that our purpose is to create students who want to learn, challenge themselves, and enjoy what they are doing. Suffice it to say, the book&#x2019;s techniques and &#x201c;power craft moves&#x201d; will ultimately improve test scores, but the conversations our students engage in will help them become active, involved, and independent readers and writers. Shubitz provides guidance in literacy instruction that will result in independent, proficient and talented writers.<br> This is the book you have been waiting for, hoping for, dreaming about. It&#x2019;s a book that will become your friend and your confidant &#x2014; a a must-have book for any literacy teacher. You and your students will become hunters and gatherers of power craft moves, and their writing will reach a new dimension!<br><i><b>Linda Biondi</b></i><i>&nbsp;is a fourth grade teacher at Sharon Elementary School in Robbinsville, NJ, and a long-time Morning Meeting practitioner.

A standout at the University of Florida, he helped the Gators win the national title in 2008. Drafted by the New England Patriots, in his second full season with the team he and fellow Patriots&#x2019; tight end Rob Gronkowski set records for touchdowns and yardage, and with Tom Brady, led New England to Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. But Aaron&#x2019;s NFL career ended as quickly as it began. On June 26, 2013, he was arrested at his North Attleboro home, charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd, and released by the Patriots. Convicted of first-degree murder, Aaron was sentenced to life in prison without parole. On May 15, 2014, while on trial for Lloyd's murder,&nbsp;Aaron was indicted for two more murders. Five days after being acquitted for those double murders, he committed suicide in his jail cell. Aaron Hernandez was twenty-seven years old. </p><p>In this clear-eyed, emotionally devastating biography&#x2014;a family memoir combining football and true crime&#x2014;Jonathan (formerly known by his nickname DJ) Hernandez speaks out fully for the first time about the brother he knew. Jonathan draws on his own recollections as well as thousands of pages of prison letters and other sources to give us a full portrait of a star athlete and troubled young man who would become a murderer, and the darkness that consumed him. Jonathan does not portray Aaron as a victim; he does not lay the blame for his crimes on his illness. He speaks openly about Aaron&#x2019;s talent, his sexuality, his crimes and incarceration, and the CTE that ravaged him&#x2014;scientists found that upon his death, Aaron had the brain of a sixty-seven-year old suffering from the same condition. Filled with headline-making revelations, <em>The Truth About Aaron</em> is a shocking and moving account of promise, tragedy, and loss&#x2014;of one man&#x2019;s descent into rage and violence, as told by the person who knew him more closely than anyone else.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Hernandez&nbsp;was a starting quarterback at Bristol Central High School, where he was named the Connecticut&#x2019;s Gatorade Player of the Year in 2003. He went on to play at the University of Connecticut, where he became a 2x team captain and earned his Master&#x2019;s degree in educational psychology. He later had coaching stints at Brown University (2011), The University of Miami (2012) and The University of Iowa (2013-14).

Her public persona is academic nerd, but in private, she is a rebel. Frances is a fan of offbeat podcasts, and her favorite by far is Universe City, whose agender main character (who is also the show's creator) goes by the name of Radio Silence. Frances has joined a fandom Tumblr account, using the moniker Toulouse, and occasionally posts sketches that reflect how she thinks the characters and settings might look. When she receives a message from the creator asking if she is willing to provide graphics for the show, she can't believe it. Frances is even more dumbfounded when she discovers that the mysterious Radio Silence is, in reality, Aled Last, who lives directly across the street from her.

But as the start of Frances's senior year in high school and Aled's first year at university approach, a revelation changes their close relationship. With their friendship in ruins and Aled miles away and spiraling into a dangerous depression, Frances must face long-buried fears and desires to find a way to save him.

Whether made by the tip of a pencil<br>or the blade of a skate, the magic starts there.</em><br><br>And magic once again flows from the pencil and imagination of internationally acclaimed artist Suzy Lee. With the lightest of touches, this masterwork blurs the lines between real and imagined, reminding us why Lee's books have been lauded around the world, recognized on New York Times Best Illustrated Books lists and nominated for the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international honor given to children's book creators. This seemingly simple story about a young skater on a frozen pond will charm the youngest of readers while simultaneously astounding book enthusiasts of any age.</p><p>Suzy Lee lives in Seoul, South Korea, and is the author of award-winning children&#39;s books.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;An unseen artist sketches a deft ice skater making beautiful lines on the ice. Straight lines, squiggles, and curls, the combinations are endless. Then, suddenly, the ice skater falls, disrupting the fluidity and gracefulness of the story. The artist seems displeased with this development and starts anew on the following page. In this wordless picture book by Lee, readers can tell when the artist is changing the story line by the crinkled sketch paper and erasure mark illustrations. Through drawings alone, the message that everyone falls, but it is important to get back up and try again is delivered flawlessly. Supremely crisp, clean, and appealing, this is the kind of artwork that will entice readers to return to the pages again and again to see what detail they may have missed. The pages of the book are mostly a bright white, touched by the gray lines of the pencil drawings. The tiny splashes of color pop in the wintry hats and coats of the ice skaters as more figures emerge and the scene unfolds. Somehow, even with the cool white pages and cold, wintry landscape, this picture book for all ages will make readers feel warm inside. VERDICT Any lover of picture books will appreciate this graceful wordless gem. A great discussion starter and drawing prompt to see where a single line might lead.&#x2014; Amy Shepherd, St. Anne's Episcopal School, Middleton, DE</p><h2>Anatomy Test</h2><p>Test yourself on over 1,400 anatomical identifications.

Presented in a highly scannable yet personable style, each guideline includes an explanation and rationale, key steps, a case example, and resources for further study. The 115 guidelines are organized into six sequential categories that mirror the phases of a strategic foresight activity: Framing, Scanning, Forecasting, Visioning, Planning, and Acting.<br><br>This second edition provided an opportunity to update the examples for the guidelines where they seemed dated. Otherwise, the original guidelines are intact, in the same place and order. The more significant change is the addition of a new section that provides specific &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; process advice to supplement the guidelines. We have been working on our approach to doing and teaching how to do foresight projects for the University of Houston Foresight Program since the book was published in 2007.

But many single adults are tired of the &#34;how far is too far?&#34; approach because it doesn&#39;t go far enough. Why does the discussion stop at the physical? What about the deeper spiritual and relational aspects of sexuality? Pioneering Christian sex therapists Doug Rosenau and Michael Todd Wilson team up in this helpful and hopeful book about understanding sexuality and intimacy beyond what our &#34;do it if it feels good&#34; culture says it is. Providing a much-needed spiritual perspective to the sexuality debate, the authors tackle difficult topics from a biblical foundation to help single adults establish practical models for maintaining purity and creating a healthy sexuality. With real-life personal stories, Soul Virgins helps singles accept their sexuality as a godly discipline. Rosenau and Wilson provide a 3-D discussion of body, soul, and spirit that proves sexuality is ultimately more about relational intimacy than just the physical act of sex. Originally published in Paperback by Baker Books.</p><p>When &#34;How far is too far?&#34; doesn&#39;t go far enough Most books on single adult sexuality limit the discussion to the physical. But there&#39;s more to your sexuality than your body. It&#39;s time to look at the big picture and talk about sex in terms of body, soul, and spirit--that&#39;s soul virginity. Soul virgins are single people who seek to celebrate God&#39;s design for sexuality in themselves and others. With solid biblical principles, practical tips, and candid discussions, Soul Virgins can help you create a foundation for sexual wholeness you&#39;ll be happy to embrace at any stage of life! &#34;With great wisdom and remarkable insight, Rosenau and Wilson escort singles into a much fuller understanding of the beautiful gift that God has woven into the fibers of their being--their sexuality. This is a must-read for Christian singles!&#34;--Shannon Ethridge, coauthor, Every Young Woman&#39;s Battle &#34;It&#39;s rare to find a book with content that is new and original, but this long-overdue book is just that.

She graduated from Vassar College. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her family. <i>Nest</i> is her first novel.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;It's the dog days of the summer, 1972, and spirited 11-year-old Naomi "Chirp" Orenstein tries to enjoy them as best she can&#x2014;but something is wrong with her mother's leg. Chirp's mother Hannah is a dancer and the prospect of permanent limited mobility is both heartbreaking and terrifying. A diagnosis of MS sends Hannah spiraling into a debilitating depression, and she is sent to a mental hospital. Chirp's father, a psychiatrist, is consumed with grief and tethered to work, leaving Chirp and her older sister Rachel alone much of the time. After several months of therapy, Hannah returns home. The reunion is short-lived as she slips deeper into depression and tragically decides to end her life, leaving Chirp, Rachel, and their father to navigate their transformed familial relationship. A stunning debut, with lyrical prose and superbly developed characters, this novel is an emotional roller coaster that effectively conveys a family's visceral tragedy. At times tear inducing, the narrative is also vibrantly alive, assisted in part by the Cape Cod setting and refreshingly unplugged 1970s. The focus on nature and the outdoors helps set the pace as the seasonal changes quietly indicate the passage of time. Sensitive readers should be aware of the tough issues that it addresses&#x2014;suicide, depression, and personal loss. However, the story also offers a hopeful message. Strong readers who enjoy realistic fiction and the occasional good cry will savor Nest and reflect on it long after its conclusion.&#x2014;Juliet Morefield, Multnomah County Library, OR</p><h2>SAY YOU LOVE ME (Eva Rae Thomas Mystery)</h2><p><p><b></b></p><p><b> Former FBI-profiler Eva Rae Thomas is back and embedded in a true nightmare reaching deep into her own family.</b></p><p></p><p> Life is not done throwing Eva Rae Thomas curveballs. </p><p> A phone call turns her life upside down &#x2013; once again.

And a few fishermen, a tax collector, and a motley group of believers set out to change the world. In fact, they succeeded. In 16th century Europe, the Anabaptists preaching in cities by night, on back streets, and in secret corners behind rail fences set out to do the very thing the apostles had done. They, too, turned the world of their day upside down. What was the secret of their strength? In this book, Hoover explains what gave the Anabaptists their incredible spiritual strength. Was their secret a return to the Bible? No, they were far more than Biblicists. Was it a return to apostolic tradition? No, they were far more than keepers of tradition. Fundamentalism and traditionalism have never held Christianity together nor made it work. The &#x201c;secret of the kingdom of God&#x201d; is stunningly simple. With two words Christ revealed it to His disciples. Upon comprehending it, His disciples came to a sudden knowledge of the will of God, of the whole Bible, and of the right way to live. This book is more than an Anabaptist history; it is a challenge to all Christ-followers to put the teachings of Jesus into practice and to be part of a Kingdom movement that transcends the man-made boundaries of denomination.</p><p>Peter Hoover (born 1960) is an author familiar to many conservative Christians of Anabaptist and similar heritage in the United States, Canada and western Europe. He is a member of the non-sectarian Rocky Cape Christian Community in Tasmania, Australia. Born in Canada, Peter has also worked in Mexico, Costa Rica, United States, Chile, and Australia. Hoover&#39;s books have focused on the stories of Christians in recent centuries who have most closely reflected the relationships, values, zeal and impact which Christians originally claimed in the New Testament and ante-Nicene period. His books include Secret of the Strength (What Would the Anabaptists Tell This Generation?), which is published in both English [1] a German edition in Europe (as Feuertaufe. Das radikale Leben der T�ufer. Eine Provokation) [2] , and an online Spanish edition. Also, he has written Behold the Lamb (The Story of the Moravian Church), and The Russians&#39; Secret (What Christians Today Would Survive Persecution?)[3] , and The Mystery of the Mark: Anabaptist Missions under the Fire of God [4] . In 2006, Hoover was featured on the American television program, Dr. Phil, for his involvement in an effort to find and recover the children of an American mother whose father was concealing them in a Christian community in Belize. In 2010, Hoover was subject to a brain tumor. It was surgically removed in the Hobart Royal hospital on 14 July, taking away much of his ability to read and write, but he has since regained most of his former abilities.</p><h2>How to Rap 2: Advanced Flow and Delivery Techniques</h2><p><p>This sequel to <i>How to Rap </i>breaks down and examines techniques that have not previously been explained&#x2014;such as triplets, flams, lazy tails, and breaking rhyme patterns.

Not in the way that most kids do, but in an irrepressible, all-consuming, I-want-to-climb-inside-the-tube kind of way. And climb inside he did. Now presiding over Bravo's reality TV empire, he started out as an overly talkative pop culture obsessive, devoted to <i>Charlie's Angels</i> and <i>All My Children </i>and to his mother, who received daily letters from Andy at summer camp, usually reminding her to tape the soaps. In retrospect, it's hard to believe that everyone didn't know that Andy was gay; still, he remained in the closet until college. Finally out, he embarked on making a career out of his passion for television. </p><p>The journey begins with Andy interviewing his all-time idol Susan Lucci for his college newspaper and ends with him in a job where he has a hand in creating today's celebrity icons. In the witty, no-holds-barred style of his show <i>Watch What Happens Live</i>, Andy tells tales of absurd mishaps during his ten years at CBS News, hilarious encounters with the heroes and heroines of his youth, and the real stories behind <i>The Real Housewives</i>. Dishy, funny, and full of heart, the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>Most Talkative</i>, provides a one-of-a-kind glimpse into the world of television, from a fan who grew up watching the screen and is now inside it, both making shows and hosting his own.</p></p><p><p><b>Andy Cohen</b> is Bravo's executive vice president of Development and Talent, responsible for overseeing the production of such hits as <i>Top Chef </i>and <i>The Real Housewives</i> franchises. In addition, Cohen is the host and executive producer of <i>Watch What Happens Live</i>, Bravo's late-night, interactive talk show. He also hosts the network's reunion specials. He's won an Emmy and two Peabody Awards for his work, and he lives in New York City.</p><p>&lt;&gt;My Date with Susan Lucci</p><p>I'm standing on the corner of Sixty-seventh and Columbus Avenue in Manhattan waiting for a meeting that will change my life. It's December 11, 1987. I'm nineteen years old and about to have my first encounter with a celebrity. Not just any celebrity. The Queen of Daytime, and my first diva: Susan Lucci.</p><p>I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys, I'd come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann's Pop'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over All My Children and Erica, her clothes, and her narcissistic attitude. My sister Em and I even got my mom into the show. Which was a coup because Evelyn Cohen doesn't suffer fools: She gets the New York Times&#x2014;not Soap Opera Digest&#x2014;delivered to our house in St. Louis. And in general, Jewish women don't tend to sit around watching soaps. Don't ask me why.</p><p>Dinner "conversation" at the Cohens' meant my sister, mom, and I relaying in brutal detail the day's events in a state of amplified hysteria, while my father listened to his own smooth jazz station in his head. After dinner, my dad would rejoin the living, and I would inevitably hear the three words I dreaded more than anything else: "Wanna play catch?"</p><p>No, I did not want to play catch. Ever.</p><p>I would turn to my mom for a reprieve, who would instead give me a look that was simultaneously threatening and begging. "Just humor your father and go TOSS THE DAMN BALL!" I got out of it most times by just making a run for it and sliding into my home base, in front of the TV.</p><p>Susan Lucci was the biggest star in the daytime galaxy, and she served it up hot and fresh and chic five days a week. Before there was Joan Collins's Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter Rowan on Dynasty, there was Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick Montgomery on All My Children.</p><p>A few months earlier, the professor in my Boston University news writing and reporting class assigned us a feature story and challenged us to nab an interview with one of our idols. He said if we got someone good, we could get our article published in the BU newspaper. Finally, my ticket to something big&#x2014;a byline&#x2014;and a chance to meet and interview one of my two idols: Susan Lucci or Sam Donaldson.</p><p>I didn't say Sam Donaldson just to impress my professor, either. I really loved him. During the Reagan years, he was the only member of the White House press corps who actually asked the man a direct question and held him accountable. (To this day, when I'm interviewing someone, I try to channel Sam. Of course, today my hardest-hitting interviews are usually with Real Housewives.) My admiration for Donaldson aside, when you give yourself two celebrity options on an assignment like this, you can bet that the one without the weird hair system is going to win every time.</p><p>I wrote Lucci's publicist an impassioned declaration of love, which secured me an interview, which was then postponed . . . multiple times . . . until this day. Fearful that I was one more postponement away from cancellation, I woke up at 7 a.m. and began calling that publicist's office to nail down the details and get my instructions for the day. All I knew was that I was supposed to meet Susan Lucci. The rest was a mystery, and I wanted it solved. I dialed and dialed and the phone rang and rang. By 9 a.m. I was convinced this interview, like the others, wasn't going to happen. But I was already in New York City! I couldn't go home empty-handed. Ruefully, I decided that Sam Donaldson's publicist never would have blown me off, if Sam Donaldson indeed even had a publicist. Probably not. Sam Donaldson was too down-to-earth, and there's no way a publicist would have just let that hair thing go.</p><p>Three hours after I'd begun, I deliberately punched in the now memorized sequence of numbers in a last-ditch effort. One ring. Two rings. Three, four, five, six, seven . . . and then someone, an assistant I guess, finally picked up. I was told to report to the ABC studios on the Upper West Side at 12:30. And that's how I learned that people in New York don't start working until 10 a.m. How cushy.</p><p>I get momentarily dizzy when I see the marquee that says, "In Pine Valley, Anything Can Happen." Of course, I've arrived outside the studio an hour early wearing bar mitzvah attire: button-down, paisley tie, sport jacket, and a trench coat that could have been from the Mini-Dan Rather Collection. My hair is more awkward than normal, as I'm in the midst of growing it out to Deadhead perfection. I tamed the Jewfro when I woke up, but its stability is threatened by the humidity of an unseasonably warm December day.</p><p>But I haven't shown up with sixty minutes to spare just to stand around and gawk like a tourist. I have something else on my agenda. In addition to the Lucci interview, I'm working on a creative writing paper examining whether Pine Valley is an accurate representation of society. (Just the sort of deep topic my parents expected me to be exploring when they signed my enormous BU tuition check.) I've brought my tape recorder to nab on-the-street interviews with actors from the show.</p><p>Occasionally a Pine Valley "resident" walks out of the stage door and I first internally freak out ("OMG IT'S CLIFF!"), then attack them with my recorder. I see myself as a Sam Donaldson type; they probably see me as a John Hinckley Jr. type.</p><p>"IS PINE VALLEY AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF SOCIETY?!" I yell at every familiar face in a high-pitched panic. They are all initially terrified and must take a moment to process what is happening: overly hyper kid with tape recorder and 'fro yelling stupid question. Once they realize I'm probably not going to shoot any of them to impress Jodie Foster, I get quick interviews with "Donna," "Cliff," "Ross," "Travis" (who has dried shaving cream on his ear), and even the man who plays Palmer's butler, "Jasper." Their answers are gripping&#x2014;"Not really." "No." "Maybe."</p><p>At 12:30, euphoric after my journalistic ramp-up to the main event, I walk into the building and announce that I'm there as a guest of Ms. Lucci. "Susan Lucci," I say, triumphantly. "I am Andrew Cohen and I am here to see Susan Lucci."</p><p>The guard nonchalantly mumbles into a microphone, and his voice crackles over a loudspeaker, "Susan Lucci, guest in the lobby." I am stunned at his informality and offended by his lack of respect when summoning the actress who plays Erica Kane.</p><p>I wait in terror, convinced that something, yet again, will go awry: I've gotten the day wrong, or Ms. Lucci's changed her mind. Or it could go exactly as I'd imagined&#x2014;a minion would appear to spirit me away to Erica Kane's penthouse lair. After a couple of minutes, the double doors open, and she glides toward me. Susan Lucci. Radiant. Confident. Really, really small. Like, child-sized, even. My moment of disconcertion at how this person who is larger than life to me could be so alarmingly pint-sized is short-lived, as she opens her mouth to speak.</p><p>"You must be Andrew," she coos.</p><p>She is wearing a red knit dress, red hoop earrings, black heels, a full-length mink coat, and massive sunglasses. Her hair is teased three stories high: a masterpiece of eighties glamour and engineering.</p><p>I finally stammer out something that sounds like "HI!"</p><p>"Well, I hope you like Mexican food, Andrew, because I'm taking you to lunch," she purrs.</p><p>In fact, I hate Mexican food. I have a lifelong aversion to beans, and I wanted to see the studio. On the other hand: Susan Lucci and I are going to lunch? On a date? ¡Me gusta!</p><p>"Oh my god, I looooove Mexican food!" I scream.</p><p>The publicist shows up just as we're walking out of the building. She's tall, wearing a butter-leather jacket, with frosted hair pulled back, a smoker's voice, and an air of cosmopolitan authority. We walk a few blocks to a restaurant called Santa Fe. On the way, some nutbag on the street asks Lucci if she received his card.</p><p>"Your card?" she asks. She seems concerned. "Oh nooo, I didn't! I'll check with the guard," she says very sincerely, turning to me with a wink. She and I know she'll not be checking with the guard. I'm in on the joke with Susan&#x2014;on the inside of inside. I marvel at her ability to be tolerant and kind with this weirdo, making him feel as if he really matters to her, treating him as nicely as she's treating me. As we get further down the street, a guy in a truck yells, "Erica Kane! We love you!" She waves. I imagine little cartoon birds fluttering down to pick up the hem of her mink coat so it doesn't drag on the ground.</p><p>At the restaurant, we sit down at the table, and Susan and her publicist start talking quietly about a photo shoot that's coming up, and Susan says that ABC "has finally gotten it right." Susan is happy. I can't believe how super-confidential their convo feels. There is a business behind this soap I've spent my life ogling from my seat on a sofa in the middle of the country, and it is fascinating. I zero in on what Susan said about ABC "finally getting it right." What was wrong before? I wonder. Was Susan unhappy with ABC? Perhaps, as our friendship deepens, she will learn that she can trust me enough to confide in me regarding these matters. Strictly off the record, of course.</p><p>By the time they remember I'm there and turn to me, I'm convinced that my hair has expanded at least an inch in diameter since Sixty-seventh Street.</p><p>They ask me about my major, my goals. I am absolutely bullish on my future, and tell them awwwwlllll about it, while they sit there, nodding patiently, smiling patiently, and agreeing patiently. I tell them that I'm a sophomore Broadcast Journalism major and I want to be the next Dan Rather. Then, hearing myself say that and realizing that Dan Rather barely ever goes through an interview blathering about his hopes and dreams, I abruptly start reading from a list of questions I've prepared about Erica Kane:</p><p>"Is Erica mo...</p></p><h2>Fascial Release for Structural Balance, Revised Edition: Putting the Theory of Anatomy Trains into Practice</h2><p>This thoroughly revised edition of the authoritative reference <i>Fascial Release for Structural Balance</i> brings the book up to date with all of the most current research on the role of fascia and myofascia in the body, and how treatment affects it.

The authors, both respected bodywork professionals, give any bodywork practitioner using manual therapy&#x2014;including physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractors, myofascial and trigger point therapists, and massage therapists&#x2014;the information they need to deliver effective treatments and create long-lasting, systemic change in clients' shape and structure.<br><br>Fascia, the soft tissue surrounding muscles, bones, and organs, plays a crucial role in supporting the body. By learning to intelligently manipulate it, a bodyworker or therapist can help with many chronic conditions that their clients suffer from, providing immediate pain relief as well as reducing the strains that may contribute to the patient's ongoing aches and pains, leading to rapid, effective, and lasting pain relief.&nbsp;James Earls and Thomas Meyers argue that approaching the fascia requires "a different eye, a different touch, and tissue-specific techniques."</p><p>James Earls is the director of Ultimate Massage and Kinesis UK.

Anna keeps passing Michael books until one day he disappears, suddenly released after a private detective manipulated a witness in Michael's trial. <br> Outside, Michael encounters a Washington, D.C. that has changed a lot during his time locked up. Once shady storefronts are now trendy beer gardens and flower shops. But what hasn't changed is the hard choice between the temptation of crime and doing what's right. Trying to balance his new job, his love of reading, and the debt he owes to the man who got him released, Michael struggles to figure out his place in this new world before he loses control. <br> Smart and fast-paced, <i>The Man Who Came Uptown </i>brings Washington, D.C. to life in a high-stakes story of tough choices. <br></p><p>George Pelecanos is the bestselling author of twenty novels set in and around Washington, D.C.

Pelecanos' peppery dialogue energizes every page."&#x2015;<b>Lloyd Sachs</b>, <b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>"This is a book about love of family, about the stresses that can lure almost anyone into crime and about how hard it can be for someone [to] make it on the outside.

John Vervaeke, Christopher Mastropietro and Filip Miscevic seek to answer this question by arguing that particular aspects of the zombie, common to a variety of media forms, reflect a crisis in modern Western culture. &nbsp;</p><p>The authors examine the essential features of the zombie, including mindlessness, ugliness and homelessness, and argue that these reflect the outlook of the contemporary West and its attendant zeitgeists of anxiety, alienation, disconnection and disenfranchisement. They trace the relationship between zombies and the theme of secular apocalypse, demonstrating that the zombie draws its power from being a perversion of the Christian mythos of death and resurrection. Symbolic of a lost Christian worldview, the zombie represents a world that can no longer explain itself, nor provide us with instructions for how to live within it.</p><p>The concept of&nbsp; 'domicide' or the destruction of home is developed to describe the modern crisis of meaning that the zombie both represents and reflects. This is illustrated using case studies including the relocation of the Anishinaabe of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, and the upheaval of population displacement in the Hellenistic period. Finally, the authors invoke and reformulate symbols of the four horseman of the apocalypse as rhetorical analogues to frame those aspects of contemporary collapse that elucidate the horror of the zombie.</p><p>Zombies in Western Culture: A Twenty-First Century Crisis is required reading for anyone interested in the phenomenon of zombies in contemporary culture. It will also be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience including students and scholars of culture studies, semiotics, philosophy, religious studies, eschatology, anthropology, Jungian studies, and sociology.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Heft: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>"A stunningly sad and heroically hopeful tale...This is a beautiful novel about relationships of the most makeshift kind." &#x2015;<em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em></strong></p><p>Arthur Opp weighs 550 pounds and hasn&#x2019;t left his rambling Brooklyn home in a decade.

How to Prepare for and Recover from Total Hip Replacement</h2><p>Get Hip! tells the story of hip replacement, from the first pains of osteoarthritis, through medical decisions, surgery and recovery. It is the story of retired journalist Rob Taylor and 11 other hip surgery patients, men and women, ages 30 to 88. It&#x2019;s written for patients, so it glosses over some medical complexities. But includes medical studies, tips, exercises and insights from orthopaedic surgeon Wayne E. Moschetti, MD, MS and guidance from Be Fit Physical Therapist David Barlow, DPT, OCS. Get Hip! explains how to plan and prepare for surgery. It talks about managing pain, physical therapy and drugs. It tells how long it took this dozen patients to get back to active lives. And it includes their confirmation that the surgery improved their lives.</p><p>Rob Taylor is a recovering journalist who can't stop writing. In May, 2018, he got his right hip replaced with metal and plastic parts. Unable to find answers to many of his questions about preparation and recovery, he decided to write a book.

Kennedy is inaugurated, Claire, an uncompromising young wife and mother obsessed with the glamour of Jackie O, struggles over the decision of whether to stay in a loveless marriage or follow the man she loves and whose baby she may be carrying. Decades earlier, in 1919, Vivien Lowe, an obituary writer, is searching for her lover who disappeared in the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. By telling the stories of the dead, Vivien not only helps others cope with their grief but also begins to understand the devastation of her own terrible loss. The surprising connection between Claire and Vivien will change the life of one of them in unexpected and extraordinary ways.

This is a deeply engaging and moving book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andre Dubus III, author of <i>Townie</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this poignant and incisive novel, Ann Hood brings history back to life in the most intimate way, chronicling the love affairs and heartbreaks of two very different women in two very different times. Moving gracefully and persuasively between post-earthquake San Francisco and the early 1960s, <em>The Obituary Writer</em> makes unexpected connections between these two bygone eras, and in the process, manages to illuminate the present as well as the past.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tom Perrotta, author of <i>The Leftovers</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Hood&#x2019;s language is fine and supple, the settings are lusciously rendered, the melancholy air is seductive . . . and her intricate inquiry into grief, guilt and love is haunting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>Am I Just My Brain?

This book is a concise introduction to quantum computation, developing the basic elements of this new branch of computational theory without assuming any background in physics. It begins with an introduction to the quantum theory from a computer-science perspective. It illustrates the quantum-computational approach with several elementary examples of quantum speed-up, before moving to the major applications: Shor&#39;s factoring algorithm, Grover&#39;s search algorithm, and quantum error correction. The book is intended primarily for computer scientists who know nothing about quantum theory, but will also be of interest to physicists who want to learn the theory of quantum computation, and philosophers of science interested in quantum foundational issues. It evolved during six years of teaching the subject to undergraduates and graduate students in computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics, at Cornell University.</p><p>Quantum physics has some spectacular applications in computer science, and this book is a concise introduction to quantum computation.

Excellent as container plants, flax plants can also be spectacular planted in the ground&#x2014;in a garden or along a walkway.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here, the neutral grey of the concrete makes an ideal background on which to affix vertical stripes of color. Recontextualizing the radiating leaves as flat surfaces also highlights the smooth texture of the leaves and the striations in color.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rather than bringing the outdoors in, this treatment brings the indoors out: When lined up in strips, the broad, sword-shaped leaves begin to look like wallpaper.<br> &nbsp;<br> After attaching the blades to the step, they&#x2019;re trimmed to size, making each embellished rise a work of art.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Tools and Techniques </b><br> For this project you&#x2019;ll need large, well-sharpened, sturdy scissors or garden shears, a ruler, and a roll of removable double-sided tape, available online or in craft supply stores (other kinds of glues may leave residues or be hard to remove).<br> &nbsp;<br> If you don&#x2019;t have access to flax, you can create this effect using different kinds of leaves and wide grasses.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Field Guide </b><br><b>Gather: </b>Collect the leaves of flax plants or similar leaves and grasses. Make sure they&#x2019;re in good condition and free of spots. Choose long leaves that are consistent in size with even edges. Using sharp scissors, harvest the leaves close to the root. If you&#x2019;re harvesting from living plants, select only a few outer leaves to make sure there&#x2019;ll be no lasting damage.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Compose: </b>This project is best done on smooth steps that have a back riser. Arrange the blades with similar widths and hues. Notice how stripes of various colors take on new beauty when placed on a flat surface.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Create: </b>Measure the height of each riser. Use the ruler, or hold the leaf against the step to measure each blade to size. Then use the scissors to cut each blade of grass to length. Design your pattern on the ground, grouping blades with similar widths or hues. Adhere each leaf to the step vertically with removable double-sided tape.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Leave No Trace: </b>When you&#x2019;re ready to disband your Grass-Lined Steps, remove and discard the tape and let the leaves return to nature.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Year of Mini Mysteries: 29 Tricky Tales to Untangle</h2><p>Do you like to crack cases?

He explains what prayers are suitable for the sick, how to persevere in patience, and even how to overcome an excessive fear of death. Most importantly, St. Francis de Sales teaches about abandonment to God's will in both life and death, drawing from his memories of the deaths of his own mother and sister.<br><br> Readers of <b><i> Consoling Thoughts on Sickness and Death</i></b> will experience firsthand why St. Francis de Sales (1567-1622) is known to history as the Gentle Saint. St. Francis was Bishop of Geneva and a tireless preacher, who yet made time to correspond with numerous souls who wrote him for his insight and guidance. His <b><i>Consoling Thoughts</i></b> are compiled from these letters as well as from his other spiritual works.</p><p>St. Francis de Sales was born in 1567 to Francois and Francoise de Boisy in what is currently Haute-Savoie, France. His father sent him to a good school when he was young, and he received spiritual formation from the Jesuits. After a disturbing spiritual fear of being condemned, he eventually resolved his problem and decided to dedicate his life to God in 1587. He became a doctor of law at the age of 24 at the Jesuit College of Clermont, Paris, and was ordained a priest by Bishop Claude de Granier and stationed in Geneva in 1593. He became bishop of Geneva in 1602. <br><br> Francis de Sales is the author of various collections of sermons on Mary, Lent, prayer and Christmastide, as well as a work entitled <i>Set Your Heart Free</i>, edited by John Kirvan. He was known as a spiritually understanding man as well as a friend of the poor. Though known for his great intellect and theological wisdom, he spoke with simplicity and earnestness, so that all could understand. <i> An Introduction to the Devout Life </i>, his best-loved work, is based on notes he wrote for a cousin for marriage, stressing that sanctity is possible in everyday life. He died in 1622 on December 28, and was canonized by Pope Alexander VII in 1665.

She lives in Venice with her husband and their son.<b>From the Introduction<br><br></b>IN A QUIET CORNER OF VENICE, far off the beaten track and away from the crowds that cluster around the famous Piazza San Marco, stands a little house. Its walls are a dirty and crumbling pink plaster. Its windows, hidden behind watermelon-green shutters, look out over a sleepy canal. Were you wandering past, you most likely would not look at it twice, too beguiled by the riches and beauty the streets of Venice have to offer all around you. Were you wandering past, you might even be lost&#x2014;few visitors<br> bother coming to this unpretentious part of town by intention. But were you to pause for a moment, standing just outside the green door, in the <i>campo</i> where the cherry tree grows; were you to stop and look, what you would see is my home. The house where I grew up, where my husband and I celebrated our wedding, where my son took his first steps, and where I learned to cook.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story of how the little pink house on a Venetian backwater came to be my home is a serendipitous one. Unlike almost everyone else in my neighborhood, I wasn&#x2019;t born in Venice, nor is my family from there: we moved to the city when I was tiny and before I can really remember living anywhere else. I have no recollection of my first night in the attic bedroom at the top of our house, for example, or of seeing the city for the first time from the water. Most distinctly, I remember my mother telling me that we were to move there for a year&#x2014;and my asking if this meant that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to go to school. I was six. <br> &nbsp;<br> I did go to school, of course; and we stayed longer than a year. We&#x2019;ve never really left.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we first arrived, I spoke not a word of Italian beyond <i>ciao</i> and <i>gelato</i>. I went to the local Italian school, a charming old convent with vaulted ceilings and the prettiest of courtyards. My teacher was a petite nun with a kindly, creased face who wore an immaculately starched white wimple. We called her <i>Madre Adolfa</i> and, with all the patience in the world, she taught me Italian. She spoke no English. I remember her running water from a rusty tap into her hands, jabbing her wet finger at me, and crying &#x201c;<i>goccia</i>,<i> goccia</i>!&#x201d; the Italian word for &#x201c;drop of water.&#x201d; For a long time, I thought that <i>goccia</i> meant &#x201c;finger.&#x201d; I soon learned to speak Italian, though with a heavy Venetian accent and a fair few words of dialect mixed in. And with time, the strangeness of living in a city with no cars, traveling everywhere by boat, and splashing through the streets flooded with water when the tide comes in high became my every day, though for me it has never lost its charm. As is often the way when you come from one place and live in another, I feel no identifiable nationality: I am neither wholly English nor wholly Italian, but I am much of both. Venice, really, has always been home; and with time, I have come to think of myself as Venetian, if only by adoption.<br> &nbsp;<br> As is the way for so many of us who love to eat, my happiest childhood memories are centered on food. And as I&#x2019;ve grown older, little has changed for me on that front. I remain the kind of greedy person who<br> remembers and feels life through what she ate and how it was cooked: veal scallops, rolled in crisp bread crumbs and cooked <i>alla milanese</i>, on our wedding night; panettone filled with pistachio cream for pudding the Christmas before last; <i>bollito misto</i> with a very sharp <i>salsa verde</i> on the day my husband proposed; and cold tongue with heaps of Dijon mustard followed by a molten hot chocolate souffl� the night before our son, Aeneas, was born.<br> &nbsp;<br> I live by the belief that food is so much more than necessity. It is memories and feelings; it&#x2019;s both a reflection of and a catalyst for your mood; it is a profound way to connect with those we are privileged<br> enough to share a meal with. <br> &nbsp;<br> As I was growing up, we cooked often at home. My parents loved few things in life more than to gather around a dining table for lunch and linger there until long past the sun&#x2019;s setting. Meals were usually<br> chaotic: shared plates, hastily tossed together; flowers, cut higgledy-piggledy from the garden and plonked casually on the table. Sometimes lunch for six, though just as often for twelve or even twenty. The more the merrier&#x2014;the hum of excitable conversation playing out to a satisfying chorus of knives and forks scraping on plates, and strains of Verdi opera blaring from the tinny stereo in the kitchen. To me the chaos was magic. My memories are fully of warmth, generosity, and, above all, fun. Our life played out around the dining table, and it was made richer by the food we ate and by the cast of characters who joined us there. Somewhere along the way, I learned both to cook and to love to cook.<b><br></b></p><h2>The Death of a President: November 20-November 25, 1963</h2><p><b>William Manchester's "authoritative and powerful" account (<i>Time</i>) of President John F.

From history to prophecy, from apologetics to politics, numbers are everywhere but not clearly understood. Steve Cioccolanti has expanded this study of the meaning of numbers to include Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, Benjamin Netanyahu, Kim Clement, Osama bin Laden, the Third Temple, the 7 Noahide Laws, World War III, and much more. That is why it is 'A Prophetic Encyclopedia of Numbers.' 'The Divine Code' is a carefully researched exploration into the meaning of numbers, codes, cycles and patterns found in Scripture, nature, history, and prophecy. It demystifies familiar numbers like 7, 13, 666 and illuminates lesser known ones like 17, 58 and 708. Years of research and revelation have crafted this spiritual magnum opus that you will find an easy read and a joy to keep. Thought-provoking and highly practical, 'The Divine Code' is brimming with lively topics such as God, angels, demons, healing, dreams, different personalities, and end time prophecy. As you read it, you will fall in love with the Creator of Numbers. Let the Spirit of the Lord show you how to apply numbers to find meaning in life, fulfill your purpose, and prepare for eternity. Pick a chapter and you will find a surprising nugget of truth. As one reviewer raved, &#x201c;This is the Bible of Numbers.&#x201d; Volume I contains the number range 1 to 25. Volume II contains the number range 26 to 1000.</p><p><ul><li>"Bible Numerics is a subject that will never be exhausted. <i>The Divine Code</i> by Steve Cioccolanti certainly adds to this amazing and fascinating subject."&nbsp;</li></ul>--KEVIN CONNER, Internationally-Recognized Theologian and Author&nbsp;<ul><li>"Steve Cioccolanti's <i>The Divine Code</i> is another example of an additional 21st-century disclosure that will set the readers heart on fire with the truths he has uncovered...If you enjoy God's divine numbers' brain game, you won't want to pass up this enlightening and anointed volume on Biblical numbers code breaker."&nbsp;</li></ul>--DR.

We may say I love you, but do our actions back up that claim? Elder Lynn G. Robbins teaches us that love is more than a feeling it is a commitment, a promise to be responsible, respectful, and responsive to the needs and experiences of other. And like any other action we undertake, perfecting the act of love requires a lifetime of practice and good choices.<p> As Elder Robbins teaches, the daily choices we make in our marriages and families are what shape lasting love. He helps us to recognize the role that our agency plays in developing forgiveness, patience, kindness, responsibility, and other virtuous traits. We come to see that as we actively try to do things differently, Christ helps us to be the people He wants us to be people like Him.</p><p> Whether you're engaged to be married, a newlywed, or someone with decades of marriage under your belt, this counsel from an inspired leader will help you develop more Christlike love for those around you. As you draw closer to the Savior through your daily choices and actions, His love will fill your home.</p></p><p>Lynn G. Robbins was sustained to the Presidency of the Seventy on April 5, 2014. He became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy on april 1, 2000. Prior to that, he was a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy for three years. Elder Robbins served a full-time mission in Argentina and later served as president of the Uruguay Montevideo Mission.<p> Elder Robbins received his bachelor's degree from Utah State University and an MBA from the American Graduate School of International Management. He was one of the founders of Franklin Quest (later Franklin Covey). Elder Robbins and his wife, Jan, are the parents of seven children and eighteen grandchildren.</p></p><h2>The Girl Who Struck Out Babe Ruth (On My Own History)</h2><p><p>Jackie Mitchell has always wanted to be a great pitcher, and she finally has the chance to become one! In her first minor league game, she is up against two of the greatest home-run hitters of all time--Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Does she stand a chance?</p></p><p><p>Jeni Reeves is a painter and children's book illustrator with a background in communication and fine arts. Her illustrated picture books include authors' stories about world culture, history, biography, and folklore. Travel and study fuel Jeni's work, as does an abiding interest in history and language.</p>Grade 2-3-Jackie Mitchell always dreamed of being a great baseball pitcher, and at age 17 she signed a contract to play with the Chattanooga Lookouts. Her chance to prove herself came on April 2, 1931, during an Exhibition game against the New York Yankees when she pitched against Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, striking both out before walking Tony Lazzeri. She was then pulled from the game, which the Yankees finally won. Unfortunately, the commissioner of baseball canceled the teen's contract shortly after, claiming that the game was "too tough for women." An author's note and an afterword give additional background information about women in baseball and about Mitchell's career. Realistic, pale colored-pencil sketches break up the text, but don't really add anything to the story. Still, the easy format and large print will appeal to beginning and reluctant readers.<br><i>Nancy A.

Does your dining room d�cor carry clues to your character? Award-winning psychologist Sam Gosling has dispatched teams of scientific investigators to poke around bedrooms and offices, check out iPods, and peek at personal websites&#x2014;to see what can be learned about us simply from looking at our belongings. What he has discovered is intriguing: When it comes to the most essential components of our personality&#x2014;from friendliness and flexibility to openness and originality&#x2014;the things we own and the way we arrange them can say more about who we are than even our most intimate conversations.<p>Packed with original research and a wealth of fascinating stories, <i>Snoop</i> is a captivating guide to our not-so-secret selves, and reveals how intensely connected we are to the places in which we live and work.</p></p><p><b>Sam Gosling, PhD</b>, is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. His work has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Psychology Today</i>, on NPR, <i>Nightline</i>, and <i>Good Morning America</i>, and his research is featured in Malcolm Gladwell's Blink. He is the recipient of the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology. He lives in Austin, Texas.<p>www.samgosling.com</p><p> Reviewed by Jay Dixit</p><p></p><p> In 1942, as the United States was entering World War II, the Office of Strategic Services -- the precursor to today's CIA -- was scrambling to find promising spies to go behind enemy lines. One of the aptitude exams it developed was the Belongings Test, in which candidates had to draw conclusions about a man based purely on items in his bedroom: clothes, a timetable, a ticket receipt. </p><p></p><p> Sam Gosling, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, has made a career of studying how such clues illuminate personality. His premise is that our personalities seep out in everything we do and that expert snoopers can draw remarkably accurate pictures of us by examining the traces we leave behind. </p><p></p><p>Gosling's conclusions are supported by rigorous academic research, but his engaging book is aimed at a popular audience; he presents it as a field guide to the "special brand of voyeurism" he calls "snoopology." Few readers may actually rummage through their neighbors' garbage in search of what Gosling dryly calls "behavioral residue," but Snoop's conceit makes for an entertaining tour of how people project their inner selves outward into the world.</p><p></p><p>Some clues come from explicit, deliberate identity claims, like the Malcolm X poster on your wall or the crucifix over your bed. Others, like the songs you download or the coffee cup you throw away, are what psychologists call "seepage," messages that leak out beneath your notice. </p><p></p><p>The trick to decoding a person's space is knowing what to look for. Offices with plants, knick-knacks and symbols of friends, family and pets tend to belong to women; men display more sports items and symbols of their achievements. Rock fans are less friendly, more artistic and more anxious than fans of religious music. Extroverts offer comfortable chairs and bowls of candy as "bait" to lure people into their offices, while difficult people wind up on the remote fringes of the workplace.</p><p>This may seem like just common sense, but it's not. We think people with messy, disorganized bedrooms will be unpleasant, but we're wrong. We incorrectly assume people whose rooms are highly decorated and cluttered are more extroverted. We make similar errors in judging people directly: We expect timid, grumpy-looking people with weak voices and halting speech to be anxious and easily upset, and we expect self-assured, smiling, stylish people to be open, imaginative and curious. But neither expectation is accurate.</p><p></p><p>On a date or job interview, you may succeed in presenting a misleading impression of yourself. But since the gradual accumulation of clues in your living space is hard to fake, snooping can yield a penetrating portrait. And that, says Gosling, is perfectly okay, because though we try to put our best selves forward, most of us, in the end, want to be known not for who we wish we could be, but for who we are.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one of the main ways we carve out our identity is by consuming. We surround ourselves with things that reinforce our conception of who we are, purchasing not just the objects we need but also symbols that help us articulate our personal narratives. That's why Ramones T-shirts outsell Ramones albums 10 to one and why, Rob Walker asserts, 75 percent of Viking's ultra-high-end kitchen ranges are never used. </p><p></p><p> In Buying In, Walker, who writes a consumer behavior column for the New York Times Magazine, makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. True, we've grown skeptical of traditional advertising, the clumsy, crass kind in which someone on Madison Avenue thinks up a soft-drink jingle and broadcasts it into ubiquity. And it's true that TiVo and the Internet have given us more control over the advertisements we see. </p><p> But Walker leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. Consider the iconic mouthless cat known as Hello Kitty, used for marketing clothes, toys and bandages by the Japanese company Sanrio. She has no personality because the company painstakingly avoids defining her character, Walker says. The key to the mega-brand's success, he suggests, is ensuring that Hello Kitty remains an ambiguous symbol, a blank slate on which buyers can inscribe whatever meaning they want, from nostalgia to camp to subversiveness. </p><p></p><p>For the same reason, the makers of Red Bull never claim anything specific about the highly caffeinated drink's special ingredient, taurine, or which powers of athleticism, mental acuity or virility it supposedly bestows. They prefer marketing campaigns that promote the brand's "personality" by sponsoring such extreme sporting events as kiteboarding to Cuba, kayaking over waterfalls and street luge.</p><p>Or consider how the Pabst Blue Ribbon brand was hijacked by young, anti-corporate types. PBR's fan base grew not from aggressive marketing, Walker says, but from the lack of it. Long neglected, PBR had virtually no image at all, which helped make it an underground darling among people who attached a blue-collar, honest-workingman, anti-capitalist ethos to the brand.</p><p></p><p> Walker's analysis breaks down in places. He can't fathom why people would pay more for a Viking range or an iPod when competing products are cheaper. Most iPod buyers have never heard of such features as "Smart Playlists" and thus, he concludes, do not understand "all the functions that they paid a premium to obtain" -- as if those functions, and not the device's sleek form, are what drew 100 million purchasers. He considers the notion that people can pay for aesthetic pleasure but then dismisses it, saying it sounds more like a "rationale" than a rational choice. He's likewise baffled by why anyone would buy Method's leaky but beautiful, hourglass-shaped bottle of dish soap. Since we don't parade around town impressing others with elegant cleaning products, there's no "purely rational defense" for buying one, he says, seemingly oblivious to the possibility that we can rationally spend money on aesthetic pleasures we will enjoy alone.</p><p></p><p>But his major argument is convincing: In this new era of participatory marketing, many brands' meanings -- once crafted and maintained from atop the peaks of corporate hierarchies -- now originate from consumers. We once feared an Orwellian future in which big, scary corporations secretly manipulated our thoughts and desires. But commercial influence has become an open-source project. "We have already met the new hidden persuaders," writes Walker, "and they are us." </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

He has also released three solo albums. He has written extensively for the All Music Guide online site, www.allmusic.com. He lives in Massachusetts.</p>Exile is exactly what rock &amp; roll should sound like: a bunch of musicians playing a bunch of great songs in a room together, playing off of each other, musical communion, sounds bleeding into each other, snare drum rattling away even while not being hit, amps humming, bottles falling, feet shuffling, ghostly voices mumbling on and off-mike, whoops of excitement, shouts of encouragement, performances without a net, masks off, urgency. It is the kind of record that goes beyond the songs themselves to create a monolithic sense of atmosphere. It conveys a sense of time and place and spirit, yet it is timeless. Its influence is still heard today. Keith Richards has said, tongue in cheek, the record "was the first grunge record."</p><h2>The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2019 New-York Historical Society Barbara and David Zalaznick Book Prize in American History</b><br> <b>Winner of the 2018 American Academy of Diplomacy Douglas Dillon Award</b><br> <b>Shortlisted for the 2018 Duff Cooper Prize in Literary Nonfiction</b><br> <b>Honorable Mention (runner-up) for the 2019 ASEEES Marshall D.

Saint Dane's influence has fueled the fire of discontent between two warring tribes: the Rokador and the Batu. This is also the territory where the Traveler Loor lives as a member of the Batu. Together she and Bobby must work to thwart Saint Dane's efforts to destroy Zadaa. <br> <br> But as Bobby pursues Saint Dane, he begins to notice changes in himself.

D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.Grade 5-8 -Bobby Pendragon plunges once more into his fast-moving, rip-roaring, and basically pointless story in this sixth volume in the series. Here he and his ally, the beautiful, athletic teen-warrior Loor, team up to save Loor's home world of Zadaa from the despicable shape-changing demon Saint Dane. The villain has hatched a plot to cut off all the water from Loor's people, instigating a civil war between the thirsty Batu and the underground Rokador, with whom the Batu have until now kept an uneasy truce. The plot is about as deep as a cookie sheet, and the characterizations are even shallower-except for Pendragon, who grows as a character when he decides that he must learn to fight, and he asks Loor to teach him. Meanwhile, Saint Dane also bedevils Bobby's friends Mark and Courtney back home in Stony Brook, CT. This series treads water throughout most of its volumes; when readers reach the end of this episode, they're only microscopically farther along in the story arc than when they began. Still, the action never stops for long, and <i>Zadaa</i> is sure to hold the interest of fans of the series.<i>-Walter Minkel, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are so many rumors of horrible things that lie beyond the Line-in a place called Away-but no one dares to talk about it. And it&#39;s no use asking questions- especially of Mrs. Moore, who has always lived by the Line, or of her mother, who is just happy to have a place to stay, especially since Rachel&#39;s father died in the war. But then Rachel comes across a recorded message-one that could only have come from Away. And the voice on the recorder is asking for help. As things start to unravel, the question becomes, how far is Rachel willing to go to cross the Line and do the right thing?</p><p>Teri Hall is the author of <i>The Line</i> and <i>Away</i>. She lives in Washington with two cats and a dog.CHAPTER 1<br><br>It seemed to Rachel that she had always lived on The Property, though this wasn&#x2019;t true. Her mother, Vivian, said they moved there when she was three years old, but Rachel didn&#x2019;t remember. To her, The Property was home. She felt as comfortable there as she did in her own skin. But she knew that for most people, The Property was too close to the section of the National Border Defense System known as the Line. <br><br>The National Border Defense System enclosed the entire Unified States. The section called the Line was only a small part of it, but because of its history it was infamous, at least locally. Strange things were supposed to happen near the Line; dangerous things. Even though there hadn&#x2019;t been a Crossing Storm in over forty years, people still thought of the Line as a bad place to be near. There were whispers about Away&#x2014;the territory on the other side of the Line. There were whispers about the Others. <br><br>Rachel wasn&#x2019;t afraid. After all, she spent a lot of her time in the greenhouse that was all the way at the back of The Property, right next to the Line. Away was clearly visible from the greenhouse windows. Rachel had gazed countless hours out those windows at Away, and she had never seen anything strange over there at all. Just the same meadows and trees that were on the U.S. side of the Line. <br><br>Technically, Rachel wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be in the greenhouse. Ms. Elizabeth Moore, the owner of The Property, grew orchids there, which she shipped to the cities to sell. Vivian had always cautioned Rachel to stay away from the greenhouse; she worried that Rachel might be a bother to Ms. Moore, or that she might break something. Rachel tried to do whatever she could to make things easier for her mother, but the greenhouse had seemed magical to her from the first time she saw it&#x2014;so hushed, so peaceful and beautiful. The air was warm and soft, and a gentle light filtered in through the glass, illuminating the lush emerald hues of the orchids&#x2019; leaves. Their exotic blooms vied for Rachel&#x2019;s attention, some offering flashes of intense colors in bold shapes; others, pale and delicate, coquettishly inviting a closer inspection. <br><br>Rachel couldn&#x2019;t resist. She hid somewhere in the greenhouse almost every day when she was little, happy among the flowers. She was careful to stay out of Ms. Moore&#x2019;s sight, of course. She would have been careful even if she hadn&#x2019;t been warned not to bother her. Ms. Moore was old, and not old in a grandmotherly, &#x201c;here are some cookies&#x201d; way; she was quite forbidding. Rachel was almost scared of her. But being in the greenhouse was worth the risk. <br><br>Rachel used to lose herself there in the kind of daydreams that children who grow up in solitude often have. She&#x2019;d imagine that she was a princess, the greenhouse was her castle, and the whole of The Property was under her rule. Sometimes she would pretend that she was able to talk with the orchids. Each bloom had a different voice; some were quiet and polite, while others were loud and boisterous. Rachel made them her friends.<br><br>Rachel&#x2019;s favorite daydreams when she was a little girl were those in which her father, Daniel, was still alive and had come to take her and her mother somewhere fabulous. In those daydreams, the anxious look Vivian always seemed to wear faded, and she smiled a lot more. Daniel was dashing and handsome, and he let Rachel try things that Vivian would have scowled about, things like climbing tall trees and wandering ahead when they went on walks. In real life, Vivian was always saying &#x201c;Be careful!&#x201d; or cautioning Rachel not to stray too far. She looked at Rachel sometimes as though she were waiting for her to break, and that her own heart would break at the same time. But in Rachel&#x2019;s daydreams, if her mother started to protest that Rachel was being too reckless, Daniel would pick Vivian up and twirl her around until she laughed and laughed, and forgot her concern. In her dreams, the three of them could spend every day together, doing whatever they wanted, and Rachel never felt worried. <br><br>In actuality, Vivian was busy much of the time working in Ms. Moore&#x2019;s house, where a child underfoot wasn&#x2019;t welcomed. This left Rachel on her own quite a bit, though not completely unsupervised. Ms. Moore&#x2019;s hired man, Jonathan, had helped keep an eye on Rachel when Vivian couldn&#x2019;t. Judging from his grizzled gray hair and his bonsai fingers, twisted from years of arthritis, Jonathan was even older than Ms. Moore. Yet Rachel never felt nervous around him the way she did around his employer. <br><br>One of her earliest memories was of Jonathan; she had tripped on something and fallen, and she was crying hard. Her mom must have been working, because it was Jonathan who had gently righted her. She remembered how softly he had said her name and how she felt instantly better. Jonathan always seemed to know how to make her feel safe. He even put up with her playing in the greenhouse, though Vivian didn&#x2019;t approve, as long as she kept out of Ms. Moore&#x2019;s way. <br><br>As Rachel grew older, Vivian scheduled enough chores and homework to keep her out of most kinds of trouble, and Jonathan checked in on her less and less. Of course, she wasn&#x2019;t alone all the time. She spent every evening with her mother, and she often rode with Vivian during her weekly supply trips to Bensen, the nearest town. Trips to Bensen, where the highlight might be a treat from the bakery, were about as exciting as things got in Rachel&#x2019;s life. She hadn&#x2019;t minded that when she was little, but as she got older, she often wished that something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;would happen to her. She loved her mother, and her life on The Property wasn&#x2019;t horrible by any means. But it was predictable. Nothing ever seemed to change; no one new ever drove down the long driveway from the main road. There were no other kids to play with, and even though Rachel usually did a pretty good job of entertaining herself, she still got restless sometimes. <br><br>Away was Rachel&#x2019;s escape from boredom. <br><br>It was inevitable, really. Rachel lived right on the Line. Away was next door, and it was the opposite of boring. It was taboo. Perhaps someone with less imagination, or more friends, could have resisted the pull of something so forbidden, so tantalizingly close at hand, but Rachel was not that person.<br><br>Away had been around forever&#x2014;it was even older than Ms. Moore. Yet it was rarely spoken of, at least officially. The streamer news seldom mentioned it; people in other parts of the country seemed to have forgotten it existed. But the people in Bensen hadn&#x2019;t forgotten. And there was quite a collection of questionable literature about it available on the net. Of course, Rachel read everything she could about Away and the Others, every trashy, &#x201c;true eyewitness account&#x201d; she could find. <br><br>Vivian would have disapproved if she knew. She had always told Rachel that what happened to the Others was a tragedy, caused by government callousness. She wouldn&#x2019;t have liked the way they were described in Rachel&#x2019;s net books&#x2014;at best as mindless husks, at worst as monsters. Vivian was pretty strict about Rachel&#x2019;s streamer use anyway; it was reserved mostly for homework assignments. She did let Rachel watch a few stream shows, but only after she had screened them herself. <br><br>Vivian wanted Rachel to check out what she called &#x201c;real books&#x201d; at the Bensen library when they went to town for supplies. She&#x2019;d try to talk Rachel into books about art history or girls with pet horses. Rachel thought art history and pet horses were boring and that real books were ancient and smelly. Half of them were falling apart at the seams, and most of the ones she could find about Away were outdated. The graphics were better on the net, and you could find almost anything you wanted, right from the streamer at home. <br><br>Rachel would sneak screen time when she was supposed to be doing schoolwork. All the stories about bizarre happenings and weird animals were thrilling. Some claimed that the Others were cannibals, or that they had super-human strength. One book had outlined the process by which Others could hypnotize a person and enslave them forever, or at least until they wanted to eat them. Even Vivian&#x2019;s protests that the accounts were probably produced by government writers didn&#x2019;t dampen her enthusiasm. <br><br>Rachel made up stories in her head about how the Others would creep up to the Line and try with all their might to break through. She imagined seeing one of the odd animals she had read about that were supposed to be so common deep in Away territory, things like birds with funny heads or house cats the size of sheep. Sometimes when she was looking out the greenhouse windows, Rachel did see birds on the Away side of the Line, and more than once she had seen deer standing frozen between tree trunks, certain of their own invisibility. But the birds were just regular birds, the same as any bird she&#x2019;d ever seen, and the deer were just deer. <br><br>The Line itself was invisible. There was a barren ribbon of soil running along the meadow as far as the eye could see, where the grass couldn&#x2019;t grow. And Rachel thought she could see a funny sort of haze, but even that was only apparent in certain lights&#x2014;right before dusk, or early in the morning. <br><br>Though the Line was almost imperceptible, it had affected many lives. It affected Rachel&#x2019;s too. In a sense, the Line was the reason Rachel ended up working in the greenhouse, instead of just playing.<br><br> Her mom would have said that wasn&#x2019;t true. Rachel could hear the lecture in her head: It is always a person&#x2019;s own actions that bring about any real change, good or bad. Vivian would have said a lot more than that if she knew what really happened. <br><br>What really happened was that Rachel tried to Cross. <br><br>When the U.S. constructed the National Border Defense System, they didn&#x2019;t just ensure that their enemies were kept out. Once the invisible barrier was activated, nobody could leave the country without the government&#x2019;s permission. As far as Rachel could tell, permission was never given to regular citizens; the only people who were allowed to travel outside the borders were political officials or military troops. Crossing&#x2014;the attempt to leave the country without official permission&#x2014;was punishable by death. <br><br>Trying to Cross would have been bad enough. But Rachel not only tried to Cross, she tried to Cross the Line. Nobody ever Crossed that section of the System. There was no reason to&#x2014;there was nothing on the other side but Away.<br><br>Rachel had just finished reading yet another net article about Away. In this one, the author described &#x201c;confirmed&#x201d; sightings of strange hybrid creatures being commanded by Others, very near the Line. The creatures were supposed to be canine, but as large as horses. The author said they were incredibly beautiful and fierce, and that the Others used them for hunting. The article was dated just two days before. When she saw that, Rachel felt a shiver go down her spine. Two days ago. Confirmed sightings. Right in her backyard. Rachel wanted to see those animals. She tried not to think about exactly what they might be hunting. <br><br>She knew she had to at least try to Cross. <br><br>She figured there was only a slim chance that she would be able to, since there were only two ways that the System could ever be deactivated. One was a Crossing Storm&#x2014;a severe electrical storm that was supposed to disarm the System somehow. According to local lore, just such a terrible storm had occurred many years ago, and some Others had managed to Cross somewhere along the Line. Most official records claimed it never happened&#x2014;the government maintained that there were no verifiable accounts of anything but a terrible weather system that caused some damage. But the local weather reports still called big storms &#x201c;Crossing Storms.&#x201d; And whenever something bad happened in Bensen&#x2014;a murder, a break-in, some random vandalism&#x2014;people blamed the Others for whatever occurred. They whispered that Others were still secretly living among them. <br><br>The only other way the System could be deactivated was by the government, if some dignitary had permission to go to another country, or troops needed to Cross. There was no public record of it ever happening on the Line. None of the Crossing Stations from which sections of the System could be disabled were located on the Line. They were all on other parts of the System, the parts where they had had time to plan the construction better. On the Line, the closest thing to a Crossing Station was a little brick bunker near the edge of The Property. As far as Rachel knew, it had always been unmanned; it was locked up all the time and no soldiers ever came to check it. She thought it must be some sort of maintenance shack.<br><br>Even though Crossing was likely impossible&#x2014;or perhaps because it was&#x2014;Rachel worked herself up enough to plan an attempt. She felt like a kid who&#x2019;s been dared to go up to the &#x201c;haunted&#x201d; house at the end of some long dark road, only the person daring her was herself. In the back of her mind, she was banking on the probability that nothing would happen. Though she didn&#x2019;t believe most of what she read about the Others in the net books, if even part of it was true, she didn&#x2019;t think she would want to encounter them. Actually Crossing the Line would be the scariest thing Rachel could imagine happening. But the idea of trying was exciting.<br><br>The next morning, Rachel made the bed and did the breakfast dishes as she waited for Vivian to leave the guesthouse where they lived to go work at the main house. Then she put a hunk of cheese and some of the breakfast biscuits in a bag and set out for the back of the greenhouse. If she did somehow Cross, she might need some food. <br><br>The day was already pleasantly warm, but Rachel had brought a jacket just in case. She moved cautiously, even though there was no one around. Once she passed the greenhouse, she stopped looking over her shoulder. Nobody could see her this far away from the main house. The closer she got to the Line, the faster her heart pounded in her chest. Everything else seemed eerily quiet. <br><br>Finally, she was standing right next to the Line. The meadow grass grew long and shaggy all the way up to where the Line was, but then it died. A line of brown earth about four inches wide extended as far as Rachel could see in either direction. It was different seeing that boundary right at her feet than it was looking at it from the safety of the greenhouse. Away was right there, inches from her nose. The only thing separating her from it was the Line. All she could hear was her own breathing, and a sort of rushing sound that filled her head. <br><br>Rachel looked hard at the space in front of her, squinting her eyes to see if she could detect how the Line worked, as if something like that has a way of working that you could figure out from staring at it. Her heart thumped so hard it felt like something separate from her. <br><br>She forced herself to take a deep breath, then another. The thumping in her chest slowed some. The rushing sound in her head lessened. Finally, she extended her hand tentatively, to see if she could feel the Line, maybe just poke through a little. Her hand was shaking. As she was about to touch the place in midair where she thought it was, there was a shattering sound behind her, so loud it made her jump&#x2014;fo...</p><h2>Firefly Original Graphic Novel: The Sting</h2><p>Saffron unites the women of the Serenity crew to join her on a heist in this all-new original FIREFLY graphic novel.<br><br>Saffron -- the enigmatic rogue who captured the hearts of FIREFLY fans worldwide, as well as the heart of Capt.

Veronica has also worked in local government, delivering local drug and alcohol strategies. As a recovered alcoholic and drug addict, she has personal experience of what it takes to recover from an addiction. Veronica struggled with alcoholism through most of her twenties. As a binge drinker, she was aware for some time that something was wrong but was unable to define what it was; a chance meeting led to her finally getting help and turning her life around. At the height of her addiction, Veronica was unable to go to work without the aid of a drink; her life and confidence were in tatters. She got sober in 2000 at the age of twenty-seven. She now uses this experience to help and inspire others. She fully believes that all alcoholics and addicts can recover if they have access to the right kind of help, and that they can then go on to live life to the full. She is committed to educating and informing the public on problem drinking and addiction and has appeared regularly on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire as a specialist guest. She has also appeared on the Lorraine Kelly show on ITV, and an ITV programme entitled The Truth About Binge Drinking; she has also appeared in national magazines and publications, discussing recovery from alcoholism."Veronica Valli has written one of the clearest, most fascinating &amp; truly helpful books on addiction I've ever read.Whether you're struggling now &amp; need help, have struggled in the past, or you've ever loved an addict, this book pierces through the confusing and terrifying misinformation that surrounds this disease.&nbsp;From the first page to the last, I was completely enthralled by this brilliantly researched, refreshingly straightforward &amp; delightfully compelling book."<b>Kristen Johnston, two-time Emmy award winning actress, NYT best selling author and recovery advocate.</b><br><br>"For the first time, all the relevant information and help for the struggling alcoholic or addict is in one place.

Against virtually every Black defence after 1.d4 it offers White an easy-to-learn and reliable set of lines with interesting choices between strategic or more aggressive approaches, while avoiding tons of opening theory. <br><br>Lately an increasing number of Grandmasters such as Alexander Grischuk, Gata Kamsky, Baadur Jobava, Richard Rapport and even World Champion Magnus Carlsen have played The London System. <br><br>In this light it is surprising that so little has been published about this fascinating universal weapon.

In The Agile London System they present both historical material and recent top-level examples to provide a comprehensive overview.<br><br>The authors explain the typical plans and tactics using illustrative games with clear verbal explanations, and provide lots of tactical and strategic exercises.

He has successfully been playing the London System for many years."Most readers will welcome the fact that the authors have included a wide variety of alternatives, and looked at them with such a critical eye.

Combining unparalleled writing with endearing characters and a respect for the complexities of life, the series continues to bring people together today. The Gilmore Girls Companion takes you behind the scenes of this television classic, from the first glimmer of the idea to the making of the series finale, based on more than 40 interviews with cast and crew, including Edward Herrmann, Kelly Bishop, Michael Winters, Sean Gunn, executive producer Gavin Polone and writer Jane Espenson. Go inside the writers room, the wardrobe trailer and the editor&#39;s office as an episode comes together in a scant eight days. Along the way, relive your favorite Gilmore moments with a full program guide, complete with behind-the-scenes recollections from many of the people who made it all possible.</p><p>If you're reading this, chances are very good that even though <i>Gilmore Girls</i> ended three years ago, you simply can't get the lives and loves of the people of Stars Hollow out of your mind. I'm the same way. You've probably heard people say that they wrote a particular book because it was the kind of book they wanted to read; in this case, that's exactly what happened.&nbsp;<br>Throughout the show's seven-year run, I stalked Amazon and my local bookstores, always hoping that someone would publish a book about this, one of my favorite shows of all time. By 2008, a year after the last episode had aired, I realized that nobody was going to write one, which is when I approached my publisher about the prospect of writing one of my own. Thankfully, the head of BearManor Media is one of those souls who realizes just how important some television shows can be to people.&nbsp;After nearly three years, 480 pages, and more than 40 interviews with the cast and crew of <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, I've come to appreciate just how unique this series, and the people who worked so tirelessly behind it, really are.

She speaks of men and women who have lived and died uncomplainingly, even in the midst of great poverty and deprivation; of wealthy businessmen whose indifference has been transformed into compassion and charity, and of her encounters with people and governments around the globe. Through all of this, Mother Teresa emphasizes the need for a disciplined, loving family life, for "in the home begins the disruption of the peace of the world." Drawing on more than seventy years of selfless service to the poorest of the poor, she discusses the importance of work and prayer, charity and service, the right to life and, above all, the need to love--unconditionally and absolutely.</p><p>The authors, who worked closely with Mother Teresa during her lifetime, have drawn together stories and prayers inspired by the missionary, who worked tirelessly on behalf of India&#39;s poor with her sisters of charity. Each day of the year is assigned a brief story or blessing: A child goes without sugar so Mother Teresa may have it; a truckload of bread miraculously arrives for starving Indians when the rice has run out. Many of the passages are quotes from Mother Teresa herself, and all of them challenge the reader to live up to her saintly view of humanity and suffering. If the day-by-day approach doesn&#39;t fit, there&#39;s an easy-to-browse index, organized by theme (&#34;cheerfulness,&#34; &#34;humility,&#34; &#34;suffering&#34;). Her standards are high, however, and normal sinners may find her words more challenging than uplifting.In 365 daily entries, Mother Teresa -- beloved crusader for the poor and symbol of charity and compassion -- ruminates on the importance of work and prayer, charity and service, the right to life and, above all, the need to love, unconditionally and absolutely. Drawing on a lifetime of selfless service to the poorest of the poor, she speaks of men and women in the midst of great poverty who have lived and died uncomplainingly; of wealthy businessmen whose indifference has been transformed into compassion and charity; and of her encounters with people and governments around the globe.<p>For all those who seek to find meaning and fulfillment in life, The Joy in Loving will prove a constant source of guidance, comfort, and peace.</p></p><h2>Healing: Selections from the Sermons of Fr Phil Wolfe FSSP</h2><p>Each one of us truly desires to be happy, to be loved, and to be free. Given that, why is this so rare? Why are so few people truly happy? Why do so few have a deep inner peace? And more importantly, what can be done about it?This short work, rooted in an authentically Catholic spirituality, and written in an engaging, easy to understand style, answers those questions, starting with a basic explanation of spiritual woundedness - the fundamental cause of so much emotional bondage, unhappiness, and inability to love or be loved - and following that, provides an eminently practical guide for healing. Given the chaos and confusion reigning in Church and society, it is more urgent than ever for each person who really wants to heal, who really wants to have a truly deep and profound relationship with Jesus, to have a reliable guide. Healing: Selections from the Sermons of Fr Phil Wolfe FSSP meets that need.</p><p></p><h2>Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America&#39;s Struggle for Equality</h2><p><i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;is generally regarded as the classic account of the U.S. Supreme Court's epochal decision outlawing racial segregation and the centerpiece of African-Americans' ongoing crusade for equal justice under law.<br><br>The 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of&nbsp;Brown v. Board of Education&nbsp;brought centuries of legal segregation in this country to an end. It was and remains, beyond question, one of the truly significant events in American history, "probably the most important American government act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation," in the view of constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak. The Brown decision climaxed along, torturous battle for black equality in education, making hard law out of vague principles and opening the way for the broad civil rights upheavals of the 1960s and beyond.<br><i></i><br><i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;is the story of that battle. Richard Kluger traces the background of the epochal decision,from its remote legal and cultural roots to the complex personalities of those who brought about its realization. The result is a landmark work of popular history, graceful and fascinatingly detailed, the panoramic account of a struggle for human dignity in process since the birth of the nation.<br><br>Here is the human drama, told in all its dimensions, of the many plaintiffs, men, women, and children,variously scared or defiant but always determined, who made the hard decision to proceed - bucking the white power structure in Topeka,Kansas; braving night riders in rural South Carolina; rallying fellow high school students in strictly segregated Prince Edward County,Virginia - and at a dozen other times and places showing their refusal to accept defeat.<br><br>Here, too, is the extraordinary tale,told for the first time, of the black legal establishment, forced literally to invent itself before it could join the fight, then patiently assembling, in courtroom after courtroom, a body of law that would serve to free its people from thralldom to unjust laws. Heroes abound, some obscure, like Charles Houston (who built Howard Law School into a rigorous academy for black lawyers) and the Reverend J.A. DeLaine (the minister-teacher who, despite bitter opposition, organized and led the first crucial fight for educational equality in the Jim Crow South), others like Thurgood Marshall, justly famous - but all of whose passionate devotion proved intense enough to match their mission.<br><br>Reading&nbsp;<i>Simple Justice</i>, we see how black Americans' groundswell urge for fair treatment collides with the intransigence of white supremacists in a grinding legal campaign that inevitably found its way to the halls and chambers of the Supreme Court for a final showdown.&nbsp; Kluger searches out and analyzes what went on there during the months of hearings and deliberations, often behind closed doors, laying bare the doubts,disagreements, and often deeply held convictions of the nine Justices. He shows above all how Chief Justice Earl Warren, new to the Court but old in the ways of politics, achieved the impossible - a unanimous decision to reverse the 58-year-old false doctrine of "separate but equal" education for blacks. Impeccably researched and elegantly written, this may be the most revealing report ever published of America's highest court at work.<br>Based on extensive interviews and both published and unpublished documentary sources,&nbsp;<i>Simple Justice</i>&nbsp;has the lineaments of an epic. It will stand as the classic study of a turning point in our history.</p><p>&#34;An extraordinary research effort....Kluger has written three distinct books within one jacket. The first is an account of race relations in America. The second is a detailed study of the complex process--the litigation strategy--by which the five consolidated cases that we know as Brown arose and worked their way up to the Supreme Court. The third is a meticulously researched account of the process within the Supreme Court by which the Brown decision was reached.&#34;--Harvard Law ReviewSimple Justice is the definitive history of the landmark case &#34;Brown v. Board of Education and the epic struggle for racial equality in this country. Combining intensive research with original interviews with surviving participants, Richard Kluger provides the fullest possible view of the human and legal drama in the years before 1954, the cumulative assaults on the white power structure that defended segregation, and the step-by-step establishment of a team of inspired black lawyers that could successfully challenge the law. Now, on the fiftieth anniversary of the unanimous Supreme Court decision that ended legal segregation, Kluger has updated his work with a new final chapter covering events and issues that have arisen since the book was first published, including developments in civil rights and recent cases involving affirmative action, which rose directly out of &#34;Brown v. &#34;Board of Education.</p><h2>I am Caring: A Little Book about Jane Goodall (Ordinary People Change the World)</h2><p><b>The littlest readers can learn about Jane Goodall in this board book version of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Ordinary People Change the World biography.</b><br><br>This friendly, fun biography series focuses on the traits that made our heroes great&#x2014;the traits that kids can aspire to in order to live heroically themselves.

For ten days the miners fought a pitched battle against an opposing legion of deputies, state police, and makeshift militia. Only the intervention of a Federal expeditionary force ended this undeclared war. In <i>The Battle of Blair Mountain</i>, Robert Shogan shows this long-neglected slice of American history to be a saga of the conflicting political, economic, and cultural forces that shaped the power structure of twentieth-century America.</p><p><b>Robert Shogan</b> has spent more than thirty years covering the political scene in Washington as national political correspondent for <i>Newsweek</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. He is currently Adjunct Professor of Government at the Center for Study of American Government of Johns Hopkins University. He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.In this concise, dramatic and authoritative account of the bloody 1921 encounter between the mine workers and mine owners of the West Virginia coalfields&#x2014;the most tumultuous labor battle in American history&#x2014;Shogan gives us a strikingly vivid post-WWI America both utterly foreign and oddly familiar. A former political reporter for <i>Newsweek </i>and the Los Angeles <i>Times, </i>Shogan is as much good feature writer as historian. Out of a confusing and often still-disputed series of events, he sets scenes and fills in necessary background with an unfussy narrative drive. Such well-known figures as the mercurial Mother Jones and the stalwart Samuel Gompers have their roles, as do a pair of presidents (Wilson and Harding), whose dithering made a difficult situation worse. Less familiar figures such as the organizer Sid Hatfield and the detective C.E. Lively are drawn with lifelike strokes. Police raids and deportations, bombs sent through the mail and a general air of panic and "red" hysteria build as miners and owners move inexorably toward their ultimate confrontation. The tragic outcome of the battle between a group of mountain people and the full power of the emerging superstate&#x2014;with WWI hero (and later state senator) Billy Mitchell's biplanes ready, 15 years before Guernica, to bomb civilians&#x2014;is inevitable, but it is Shogan's triumph here to make the reader feel it anew. A minor quibble is the otherwise fine bibliography's failure to mention John Sayles's <i>Matewan, </i>surely an important (and reasonably accurate) version of the events in question. 10 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Hurricanes were a talented team with a near-perfect record, but for five straight years, when it came to the crunch of the playoffs, they somehow lacked the scrappy, hard-driving desire to go all the way. Now, led by senior guards Jen Pariseau, a three-point specialist, and Jamila Wideman, an All-American phenom, this was the year to prove themselves. It was a season to test their passion for the sport and their loyalty to each other, and a chance to discover who they really were.<br> <br> As an off-season of summer jobs and basketball camps turns to fall, as students arrive and the games begin, Blais charts the ups and downs of the team and paints a portrait of the wider Amherst community, which comes to revel in the athletic exploits of their girls.

A native of Portland, Oregon, she studied art at Portland State University and has illustrated several children&#39;s educational books. Until recently, Ms. Strom taught art at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired. She was inspired to create this book by her students and by her husband&#39;s love of jazz. She and her husband now live in San Francisco.PreSchool-Eloise loves bright colors. She mixes them and paints wild pictures. When she sees Rainbow Joe on the steps of her apartment building, she tells him about her colors and paintings. "I mix up red and white and make fish. Crazy pink fish swimming across my paper." He says he has a special way with colors and can "make them sing," but the child doesn't understand how a blind man like him can see colors. One day after church, Joe surprises Eloise and her mother with his saxophone. As he plays, the little African-American girl can see and hear the colors that he creates with his music. Primitive, childlike acrylic artwork in vivid colors complement the story. However, although the sentiment is admirable, the presentation isn't successful. A disjointed narrative and weak characters contribute to the overall perplexing tone of the book. The concept of "hearing" colors is too abstract for young children, who are likely to be confused by Rainbow Joe's ability to play colors as well as by Eloise's ability to see and hear them. Estelle Condra's See the Ocean (Ideals, 1994) and Bill Martin Jr.'s Knots on a Counting Rope (Holt, 1995) are more effectively done, but this title could be used one-on-one to generate discussion on what it is like to live in a world without color.<br><i>Carolyn Stacey, Jefferson County Public Library, Golden, CO </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>History of Christianity</h2><p>First published in 1976, Paul Johnson&#x2019;s exceptional study of Christianity has been loved and widely hailed for its intensive research, writing, and magnitude&#x2014;&#x201c;a tour de force, one of the most ambitious surveys of the history of Christianity ever attempted and perhaps the most radical&#x201d; (<i>New York Review of Books</i>).<br><br>In a highly readable companion to books on faith and history, the scholar and author Johnson has illuminated the Christian world and its fascinating history in a way that no other has. Johnson takes off in the year 49 with his namesake the apostle Paul. Thus beginning an ambitious quest to paint the centuries since the founding of a little-known &#x2018;Jesus Sect&#x2019;, A History of Christianity explores to a great degree the evolution of the Western world. With an unbiased and overall optimistic tone, Johnson traces the fantastic scope of the consequent sects of Christianity and the people who followed them. Information drawn from extensive and varied sources from around the world makes this history as credible as it is reliable. Invaluable understanding of the framework of modern Christianity&#x2014;and its trials and tribulations throughout history&#x2014;has never before been contained in such a captivating work.</p><p>It is now almost 2000 years since the birth of Jesus Christ set in motion the chain of events which led to the creation of the Christian faith and its diffusion throughout the world. During these two millennia Christianity has, perhaps, proved more influential in shaping human destiny than any other institutional philosophy, but there are now signs that its period of predominance is drawing to a close, thereby inviting a retrospect and a balance sheet. In this book the author has attempted to survey the whole history in one volume.Beginning with <i>Modern Times</i> (1985), Paul Johnson's books are acknowledged masterpieces of historical analysis. He is a regular columnist for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, and his work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many other publications.</p><h2>The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked</h2><p>The most famous chess set in the world... here is a new and vibrant perspective on the chess pieces that were also brought to life in the first Harry Potter movie.

Over the last fifteen or so years, the 2/1 Game Forcing bidding method has gained substantial popularity, but for various reasons it is not taught in beginner classes. This book is therefore designed for players who are familiar with Standard bidding and are interested in switching to the 2/1 method. It covers basic concepts as well as the differences between 2/1 and Standard auctions, and includes a discussion of more advanced ideas and conventions that fit particularly well with 2/1 methods.

History is wrong.</p> <p>In this seminal book, Bruce Pascoe uncovers evidence that long before the arrival of white men, Aboriginal people across the continent were building dams and wells; planting, irrigating, and harvesting seeds, and then preserving the surplus and storing it in houses, sheds, or secure vessels; and creating elaborate cemeteries and manipulating the landscape. All of these behaviors were inconsistent with the hunter-gatherer tag, which turns out have been a convenient lie that worked to justify dispossession.</p> <p>Using compelling evidence from the records and diaries of early Australian explorers and colonists, he reveals that Aboriginal systems of food production and land management have been blatantly understated in modern retellings of early Aboriginal history, and that a new look at Australia&#x2019;s past is required&#x2015;for the benefit of all Australians.</p> <p><em>Dark Emu</em>, a bestseller in Australia, won both the Book of the Year Award and the Indigenous Writer&#x2019;s Prize in the 2016 New South Wales Premier&#x2019;s Literary Awards.</p></p><p><p>Bruce Pascoe lives in Australia and has a Bunurong, Tasmanian, and Yuin heritage. <em>Dark Emu</em> won both the Book of the Year Award and the Indigenous Writer&#x2019;s Prize in the New South Wales Premier&#x2019;s Literary Awards.</p> <p>Bruce is currently working on two films for ABC TV and a novel.</p><p>&#x201c;[A] brisk and lucidly written account...This is an important and deeply researched reinterpretation of Australian history and a stark warning about the danger of accepting received wisdom at face value.&#x201d; <b>STARRED REVIEW</b> <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Unputdownable.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Darina Allen, <i>Irish Examiner</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;The truth-telling must go on.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Stephen Fitzpatrick, <i>The Australian</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;[A]n important book that advances a powerful argument for re-evaluating the sophistication of Aboriginal peoples&#x2019; economic and socio-political livelihoods, and calls for Australia to embrace the complexity, sophistication and innovative skills of Indigenous people into its concept of itself as a nation.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Aboriginal History</i></b></p></p><h2>The Goon: Bunch of Old Crap Volume 2: An Omnibus (Goon Omnibus, 2)</h2><p>From mad scientists to interdimensional chickens with teeth to a heart breaking betrayal, Lonely Street comes under all manner of threats both tragic and hilarious in this second omnibus volume of The Goon.<br> A mysterious new figure has entered the crime scene and is taking out the Goon&#x2019;s business operations one by one&#x2015;systematically intercepting shipments, murdering contacts, and alienating friends.

That sounded peaceful and contemplative and like just the thing to do when you need to figure out your life. Instead, I ended up wandering in the wrong direction because I saw a girl wearing a tiered skirt made out of two different kinds of material -- wispy tulle contrasting with heavy wool -- and she looked so incredibly cool, I just had to know where she was going. Then I got caught up studying the cherry blossoms overhead, a glorious canopy of pink and white fluff that seemed to go on forever.

Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and '40s, Ginsburg was discouraged from working by her father, who thought a woman's place was in the home. Regardless, she went to Cornell University, where men outnumbered women four to one. There, she met her husband, Martin Ginsburg, and found her calling as a lawyer. Despite discrimination against Jews, females, and working mothers, Ginsburg went on to become Columbia Law School's first tenured female professor, a judge for the US Court of Appeals, and finally, a Supreme Court Justice. &nbsp;<br> Structured as a court case in which the reader is presented with evidence of the injustice that Ginsburg faced, <i>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</i> is the true story of how one of America's most "notorious" women bravely persevered to become the remarkable symbol of justice she is today.</p><p><b>Jonah Winter</b> is the author of more than 30 nonfiction picture books, including <i>Barack</i> and <i>Sonia Sotomayor.</i> He divides his time between Santa Fe and a small town in Pennsylvania.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Stacy Innerst</b> is an illustrator who&#x2019;s received many awards for his work.

You will see the unfair world she was born into&#x2014;where boys were valued more than girls, where women were not encouraged to achieve and aspire...Here are the facts of her case." Thus begins this clever, engaging picture book biography, which chronicles Ginsburg's early years in Brooklyn, at Cornell, and beyond, highlighting the obstacles she encountered at every turn. Readers are asked to act as the jury, examining the injustices the young lawyer faced: "Exhibit F: Even among the law firms supposedly open to hiring women, not one firm would hire her. She was a woman, she was Jewish, AND she was a mother." The illustrations, rendered in gouache, ink, and Photoshop, illuminate the text with humor and sophistication. One page features the young college student perched under the sink in the bathroom, secretly studying&#x2014;everyone knew a smart, studious girl would never get asked on a date. Another shows caricatures of the large, black-robed male justices yawning, angry, or perplexed as a tiny Ginsburg reads one of her famous "dissents." The endpapers feature shelves and shelves of books in the same muted tones of the book&#x2014;cream, pale pink, black, gray, and brown. Pair with Debbie Levy and Elizabeth Baddeley's I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes Her Mark, another fabulous picture book biography on the subject.

The planet is heating up at an alarming rate and the results are everywhere to be seen. Yet, as time runs out, climate progress is blocked by the men who are profiting from the burning of the planet: energy moguls like the Koch brothers and Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Powerful politicians like Senators Mitch McConnell and Jim Inhofe, who receive massive contributions from the oil and coal industries. Most of these men are too intelligent to truly believe that climate change is not a growing crisis. And yet they have put their profits and careers ahead of the health and welfare of the world&#x2019;s population and even their own children and grandchildren. How do they explain themselves to their offspring, to the next generations that must deal with the environmental havoc that these men have wreaked? <i>Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i> takes a personal look at this global crisis, literally bringing it home.</p><p>Praise for <b><i>Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i></b><br><br>&#x201d;<b>A must read</b> for anyone concerned with climate and energy issues.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Leonardo DiCaprio<br><br>&#x201c;When in the near future the climate implodes and misery envelops the planet, <b>you will know the criminals against humanity</b> who were most directly and personally responsible from [<i>Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>].&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Ross Gelbspan, author <i>The Heat Is On</i> and <i>Boiling Point</i><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Dick Russell and Robert F.

Jessica thrusts her overbearing nosiness into a murder trial in Boston, giving the writer(s) a chance to feature various items of local scenery. Naturally Jessica solves the whole thing while everyone else is groping in the dark. Beth Porter was obviously chosen because she sounds like Angela Lansbury. Porter's rendition, however, lacks the undercurrent of kindly good humor that Lansbury projects. She handles the other characters decently, always within the Lansbury framework.

Pray with power and authority. Our words have power. Always, in all situations, while facing all circumstances, speak life! We have a choice each time we open our mouth: speak curses or blessings, speak death of life. Choose to speak life! Often I am asked to 'not build up hope' but, hope &amp; a future is what we are promised. As humans, we may not realize we ask the LORD to do what we want, because we want what we want while we may not know what the LORD has 'in store' for us: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him" 1 Corinthians 2:9. To align with the LORD's plans for our life, begin by speaking life into each situation and request for the truth is life in Christ is what we have on earth and in heaven. About the author: God has taken Sheila around the globe, church to church, business to business, nation to nation. Many confirm she walks in the five-fold ministry. She does not use a title because God does the work while He sends her as an apostle and prophet and He orchestrates all arrangements for her to preach, teach, and evangelize. People attending the conferences often say her segments are like watching someone walk out of the bible, share for a while and then, go right back in the bible, aka continue upon her journey in HIStory.</p><p></p><h2>How the Dinosaur Got to the Museum (How the . . .

This interdisciplinary approach explores the interconnection of body, mind and psyche, offering a masterful tool for restoring balance and healing developmental trauma. </p> <p></p><i> </i><p><i>BodyDreaming</i> is a somatically focused therapeutic method, drawing on the findings of neuroscience, analytical psychology, attachment theory and trauma therapy. In Part I, Dunlea defines BodyDreaming and its origins, placing it in the context of a dysregulated contemporary world. Part II explains how the brain works in relation to the BodyDreaming approach: providing an accessible outline of neuroscientific theory, structures and neuroanatomy in attunement, affect regulation, attachment patterns, transference and countertransference, and the resolution of trauma throughout the body. In Part III, through detailed transcripts from sessions with clients, Dunlea demonstrates the positive impact of BodyDreaming on attachment patterns and developmental trauma. This somatic approach complements and enhances psychobiological, developmental and psychoanalytic interventions. BodyDreaming restores balance to a dysregulated psyche and nervous system that activates our innate capacity for healing, changing our default response of "fight, flight or freeze" and creating new neural pathways. Dunlea&#x2019;s emphasis on attunement to build a restorative relationship with the sensing body creates a core sense of self, providing a secure base for healing developmental trauma. </p> <p></p> <p>Innovative and practical, and with a foreword by Donald E. Kalsched, <i>BodyDreaming</i> <i>in the Treatment of Developmental Trauma: An Embodied Therapeutic Approach</i> will be essential reading for psychotherapists, analytical psychologists and therapists with a Jungian background, arts therapists, dance and movement therapists, and body workers interested in learning how to work with both body and psyche in their practices. </p> <p></p></p><p><p><strong>Marian Dunlea</strong> is a Jungian analyst and head of training in BodySoul Europe, part of the Marion Woodman Foundation. She is a Somatic Experiencing Trauma therapist based in the west of Ireland and is the creator of BodyDreaming.</p> <p></p><p></p> <p>"We live at a time when body and psyche are both in a traumatized state; where we are not in a relationship with nature, soul or body but dissociated from all three. The great imperative of our time is <i>reconnection </i>and moving to a more developed, evolved and individuated state of consciousness. Profoundly steeped in Jung&#x2019;s approach to the psyche as well as other methodologies (particularly the work of Marion Woodman, Donald Kalsched, Peter Levine, and Allan Schore), this inspiring book shows us how great a transformation can be wrought through the medium of BodyDreaming. Marian Dunlea approaches the client with the utmost reverence, gentleness and awareness of the fragility of psychic processes and their connection to neural pathways and nervous system responses.</p> <p>Dunlea shows us how, through reconnection with our heart and the dawning of insight, we can become illumined, healed and restored to wholeness." - <strong>Anne Baring </strong>PhD, author of <i>The Dream of the Cosmos: A Quest for the Soul</i></p><i> </i><p><i>"BodyDreaming, </i>Marian Dunlea&#x2019;s new and unique approach,<i> </i>arrives as a breath of fresh air. It provides us not only with a new way to think about our work theoretically, but with new practical ways of perceiving and attending to how our patients actually experience our interventions<i> </i>in the body. It represents a creative synthesis of new findings in the fields of affective neuroscience, attachment theory, infant observation, and body-sensitive approaches to therapy, as they apply to somatically informed psychotherapeutic work with trauma, dissociation, and dreams. </p> <p></p> <p>Marian Dunlea&#x2019;s <i>BodyDreaming</i> provides a way of getting 'underneath' the seemingly intractable defenses and resistances that our traumatized patients present to us, without our having to forsake the mytho-poetic imagination and its symbolic riches found in dreams, active imagination and the other products of the unconscious.</p> <p></p> <p>The extensive verbatim write-ups of actual clinical vignettes in the text demonstrate Marian&#x2019;s exquisite attunement to the felt experience reported by her clients. For all of us seeking a more relevant and effective way of working, these verbatim accounts are illuminating to read. Doing so has already improved my practice as an analyst." <b>- Donald E. Kalsched, PhD, Santa Fe, New Mexico</b></p><b> <p></p></b> <p>"<i>BodyDreaming </i>brings together the analytic legacy of Carl Jung with developments in the fields of Body Oriented Psychotherapy. It shows that we remain, elusively, disconnected from our dreams (and inner images), until we can embody them through interoceptive awareness. This transformative process, catalyzed through connection to the Living, Sensing, Knowing Body, bridges the dream world to here-and-now experience. In this way, we nourish the deep Self, the True Self, and our connection to inner aliveness and vitality. I believe that this book contributes to a rich dialogue between analytic and experiential therapies; a dialogue that will certainly enhance both." - <b>Peter A. Levine, author of <i>Waking the Tiger, Healing Trauma</i> and <i>In an Unspoken Voice, How the Body Releases Trauma and Restores Goodness</i></b></p><b> <p></p></b> <p>"In this highly readable book, Marian Dunlea shows us the seamless constant unconscious conversation between the body and the mind. Every thought we think is companioned by a physical response. &#x2018;When you do not know what matters most to you that, then, can become the matter with you.&#x2019; It is essential to understand that trauma becomes an emotional pattern and/or a symptom that can unconsciously govern your life perspective and your self-esteem. The talking cure alone does not free the body from the emotional responses that it carries. The body cannot and does not lie.</p> <p>Dunlea offers both the practitioner and the participant the vital keys to unlocking this deeply healing truth." - <b>Paula M.

To this end, the book describes and explores those elements that are specific to pediatric psychopharmacology; this defines and positions the volume at the nexus of child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatrics, and pharmacology. A stellar roster of contributors addresses new treatments for youths with disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, and psychotic illnesses and tackles some of the most important emerging issues in the field. For example, advances in understanding the long-term treatment effects of medications in pediatric populations are thoroughly reviewed, including not only maintenance studies that consider the durability of efficacy but also clinical trials of greater duration designed to specifically evaluate long-term safety. In addition, recent studies of combination therapies are examined, helping clinicians better understand how to treat the complicated patients that arrive every day at a prescribing clinician's office. Finally, because research designs now include a broader base of patient populations to make the data more applicable to everyday clinical practice, the book focuses on head-to-head studies with multiple active comparators.</p><p>The book offers clinicians comprehensive, accessible information and boasts a multitude of helpful features: - The book is organized by diagnosis instead of agent class. This makes it a true clinical desktop reference that allows clinicians to quickly and efficiently search treatment options and the evidence base on a case-by-case basis. DSM-5 criteria and information on comorbidities are also included.- The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice Parameters are integrated into the discussion, where applicable, in support of standard of care.- The book has been updated to include the latest research at the time of publication.- A new chapter has been added to address eating disorders, an area where psychopharmacological research that may apply to children and adolescents is now being pursued.- Useful features to help the reader understand and retain the material include clinical summary points, easy to read tables, and current and carefully vetted references. </p><p>The Clinical Manual of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, Third Edition, is an indispensable guide to the substantive research that has been done in nearly every area of pediatric psychopharmacology, as well as the major improvements that have been made to the evidence-based practice of treating youths with psychiatric illness.</p></p><p><p>The Clinical Manual of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology is designed to help clinicians provide the best evidence-based and most up-to-date care for the pediatric patient population. Because pharmacokinetic processes in children and adolescents can vary significantly from those in adults, it is critical that clinicians have access to the latest information on indications, medications, dosages, interactions, side effects, and off-label use for the pediatric patient population. The third edition reflects advances in this rapidly growing field and includes the latest research on the psychopharmacological treatment of children. Each chapter has been revised and updated in detail, emphasizing what has been learned since the last edition. A new chapter has been added to address eating disorders, which have become a topic of psychopharmacological research with respect to children and adolescents, and new authors have been added to other chapters to provide the broadest perspectives on the available literature.</p><p>The Clinical Manual of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology provides clinicians -- from psychiatrists to residents to psychiatric nurses -- with both the empirical and the practical guidance they require to successfully treat young people with psychiatric illness.</p><p>Molly McVoy, M.D., is Assistant Professor and Training Director in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University Hospital Case Medical Center, and Research physician at the Discovery and Wellness Center for Children, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><p>Robert L.

The text has been revised and reorganized with current chapters focusing on the history of cortisol use, sources of confusion regarding cortisol therapy, the significance of normal adrenocortical function, generally accepted uses of physiological dosage, viral infections, miscellaneous clinical conditions, and future directions for research and therapy. The author provides explanation and confirmation of the rationale for the effectiveness and safety of the uses of physiological dosages of cortisol in the treatment, not only of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, but also of patients with chronic allergies, chronic fatigue syndrome, gonadal dysfunction, infertility, shingles, acne, hirsutism, respiratory infections, and other less common disorders. It is a known fact that the influenza virus attacks the human body by impairing the production of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which, in turn, impairs the production of cortisol; the only hormone that is absolutely essential for life. In addition, within the past two years, a new infection has developed in central China and has been labeled Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The ACTH hormone and the SARS epidemic is addressed, and it is hoped that this type of cortisol therapy will not only be helpful in the treatment of the various disorders mentioned but will lead to a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of these disorders and ultimately contribute towards their prevention.</p><p></p><h2>Darkest Minds, The-A Darkest Minds Novel, Book 1</h2><p><strong>Soon to be a major motion picture!</strong><p>When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government "rehabilitation camp." She might have survived the mysterious disease that killed most of America's children, but she and the others emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.</p><p>Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.</p><p>But when the truth about Ruby's abilities-the truth she's hidden from everyone, even the camp authorities-comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. On the run, she joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp: Zu, a young girl haunted by her past; Chubs, a standoffish brainiac; and Liam, their fearless leader, who is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can't risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.</p><p>While they journey to find the one safe haven left for kids like them-East River-they must evade their determined pursuers, including an organization that will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. But as they get closer to grasping the things they've dreamed of, Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living. </p></p><p>Alexandra Bracken was born and raised in Arizona, but moved east to study at the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia.

Ruby Daly and other survivors from her town are taken to Camp Thurmond by the Psi Special Forces to be tested, categorized, and, according to the PR, "rehabilitated." There is no rehabilitation, though, in the concentration camps for young people with special powers, just drudgery and punishment. Ruby hides a secret from the PSF-she is not a Green, but an Orange, someone who can affect other people's minds. Members of the Children's League help her to escape but she is soon on the run from them as well when she learns that they intend to use her to commit violence. She joins the small band of Liam and Chubs, who are telekinetics, or Blues, and Zu, who is a Yellow, a person who can control electricity and machinery. Together the four seek East River, a sanctuary whose leader, the Slip Kid, can supposedly get messages to their parents. Before they can find the camp, they have to evade PSF soldiers, bounty hunters, and the Children's League, as well as solve the riddle of its location. While this story is full of action, it is also given depth by the difficult choices that Ruby faces. There are some fairly disturbing events and images (torture, rape, blood splattering, etc.). This book is a natural for dystopia fans but romance readers will also enjoy the blooming love between Ruby and Liam.-Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WI&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

In it, Aristophanes employs a mixture of shrewd logic and raffish humor that fully exploits the rich comic potential of the story and its underlying antiwar sentiment. Always a favorite of audiences, <i>Lysistrata</i>, because of its pointed feminist sympathies, is studied and performed today more than ever.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Preaching in the Purple Zone: Ministry in the Red-Blue Divide</h2><p>Preaching in the Purple Zone is a resource for helping the church understand the challenges facing parish pastors, while encouraging and equipping preachers to address the vital justice issues of our time.This book provides practical instruction for navigating the hazards of prophetic preaching with tested strategies and prudent tactics grounded in biblical and theological foundations. Key to this endeavor is using a method of civil discourse called &#x201c;deliberative dialogue&#x201d; for finding common values among politically diverse parishioners. Unique to this book is instruction on using the sermon-dialogue-sermon process developed by the author that expands the pastor&#x2019;s level of engagement on justice issues with parishioners beyond the single sermon. This book equips clergy to help their congregations respectfully engage in deliberation about &#x201c;hot topics,&#x201d; find the values that bind them together, and respond faithfully to God&#x2019;s Word.</p><p>Rev. Dr. Leah D. Schade is assistant professor of preaching and worship at Lexington Theological Seminary in Lexington, Kentucky. She is an ordained minister in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America with, twenty years of experience. She has pastored three different Pennsylvania churches, in suburban, urban and rural settings with members spanning the red-blue political spectrum. Leah earned both her MDiv and PhD degrees from the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, and is author of the book Creation-Crisis Preaching: Ecology, Theology and the Pulpit (Chalice Press, 2015). She has been an activist for environmental justice issues for over a decade.Although the title of [Schade's] book focuses on preaching in the purple zone&#x2014;implying that the focus would be on getting beyond partisan politics&#x2014;the real center of her work is examining a more dialogical approach to preaching itself. . . . She introduces a sermon-dialogue-sermon method, providing case studies, model sermons, and even an appendix of resources to announce and support the deliberative dialogue she proposes. . . . Schade has given us a clear path toward loving more and hating less, not by avoiding life in the purple zone but by directly engaging it. (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>'Preaching in the Purple Zone: Ministry in the Red-Blue Divide' would be a pretty good playbook for Democratic candidates and eco-Republicans trying to win hearts and votes. [Leah D. Schade] heard all the arguments against climate change and uses Bible verses, strategy and anecdotes honed by her love of camping and hiking (and a family that loved hunting) in an attempt to change the opinions denialists and skeptics. (<i>Albany Times Union</i>)<br><br>The book primarily targets pastors, other church leadership, and homileticians. Both its thorough research and its guide to the sermon-dialogue-sermon model make it useful for congregational leaders, but also for training seminary students so that they are more fully prepared for the difficult work of leading purple zone conversations in their future congregations. Schade has also produced a book discussion guide for lay people (see thepurplezone.net under &#x201c;Resources and Links&#x201d;). This resource could be particularly helpful in congregations that collectively want to learn as much as they can through the process, and support their pastoral leadership in what is a difficult undertaking. I came to Preaching in the Purple Zone as a long-term church staff member researching how professional Christians can be most fully ourselves in our ministry spaces. I was curious whether this book would shed light on how to prioritize pastoral care and prophetic preaching to congregants across the red-blue divide, while still acknowledging our own perspectives on hot button topics. What I discovered was light and more. I found a plausible means for my colleagues and I to foster empathy and vulnerability among congregants (and ourselves), perhaps even &#x201c;a way for healing to take place where there has been damage and pain&#x201d; [p37]. (<i>Journal of Lutheran Ethics</i>)<br><br>This book is one of the most helpful resources to teach and learn how preachers give prophetic voices to controversial justice issues in the midst of socially and politically divided times. Based on her rich experience of preaching ministry, rigorous scholarly and scientific research, and pastoral sensibility, Dr. Schade provides the reader with practical wisdom for prophetic preaching. (Eunjoo Mary Kim, Iliff School of Theology)<br><br>In these turbulent political times, Dr. Leah Schade offers a hopeful and realistic roadmap for preaching to listeners with diverse opinions. Concrete examples for a process beyond the Sunday sermon provide opportunities for growth and healing. This is a much-needed book at a critical juncture in the Church&#x2014;not just for leaders but for the laity as well. (Rev. Angela Zimmann, vice president of institutional advancement and adjunct professor of homiletics, United Lutheran Seminary)<br><br>The past generation of scholarship in homiletics has been leading to Preaching in the Purple Zone. Field tested and theologically grounded, Schade provides a truly conversational blueprint for preachers who want to preach about difficult social justice issues with their congregations rather than simply to their congregations. In our contentious cultural moment, this book is a gift to preachers, congregations, and the world. (Richard Voelz, assistant professor of preaching and worship, Union Presbyterian Seminary)<br><br>How can preachers engage diverse congregations in difficult moral conversations that often have political implications? And how can preachers preach sermons that capture the complexities of those conversations while nudging participants forward toward new and better moral understandings and social commitments? These are the core questions answered in this well-researched, clearly written, and wise book. Strongly recommended. (John S. McClure, Charles G. Finney Professor of Preaching and Worship, Vanderbilt Divinity School)<br><br>There&#x2019;s nothing sophomoric about Leah Schade&#x2019;s sophomore contribution in homiletics. Drawing its wisdom from her preaching, classroom, and community activism expertise, Preaching in the Purple Zone refreshingly offers controversy-averse pastors a quantitatively researched, timely guide for decentering the progressive versus conservative (idolatry of perspective) battle in theologically constructive ways. Schade&#x2019;s skill building &#x2018;five paths&#x2019; preaching methodology invites preachers into prophetically conscious sermon preparation and urges them to reconceive preaching as a biblical, theological, co-creative task&#x2014;one that shifts preaching&#x2019;s objective from, as she rightly puts it, &#x2018;simply opening minds and hearts, to moving hands and feet in tangible ways.&#x2019; (Kenyatta R. Gilbert, professor of homiletics, Howard University School of Divinity)<br><br>Leah D. Schade has dedicated herself as a pastor and theologian to bringing the social gospel of Christianity into congregational dialogue, and she is realistic about doing so in our polarizing and messy culture. With her commanding knowledge of homiletic literature and years of experience as a Lutheran pastor, and having surveyed over twelve hundred preachers and done training with the National Issues Forum, Schade presents a comprehensive sermon-dialogue-sermon process that can bring a congregation into respectful learning and a more consequential practice of relevant discipleship. I plan to use this book as a peer-learning resource for Roman Catholic preachers who value Catholic social teaching but seriously wonder how to preach on potentially threatening issues such as racism or health care at the end of life. (Gregory Heille, professor of preaching and evangelization, Aquinas Institute of Theology, St. Louis)<br><br>Leah Shade&#x2019;s Preaching in the Purple Zone should be required reading for pastors who preach to congregations that include both conservative and liberal listeners, seeking a way to address difficult, controversial issues. This book is a clear, profound, and practical homiletical resource for our current culture of animosity and incivility. Shade identifies fears that &#x2018;muzzle&#x2019; prophetic preaching, chief among them the objection that our preaching is &#x2018;too political.&#x2019; She offers a biblical, theological, homiletical rationale for prophetic preaching that shifts the focus from the lone voice of the preacher to a shared conversation in the congregation. She outlines a process of deliberative dialogue by which both preacher and congregation can grow together in engaging tough topics. The book includes sample sermons and detailed guidelines for addressing current issues. My advice: buy, read, and use this book!

One of them saw the shooting, and the gun is still missing. <br><br>Introducing the O'Malleys, an inspirational group of seven, all abandoned or orphaned as teens, who have made the choice to become a loyal and committed family. They have chosen their own surname, O'Malley, and have stood by each other through moments of joy and heartache.

Dee is a lifelong resident of Illinois and is active online. Visit her at [www.deehenderson.com].Few Christian novelists are currently as hot as Henderson, who is burning up CBA bestseller charts with two different series and earning a reputation for her action-packed stories of suspense, romance and courage. But this fifth installment in the O'Malley series shows a bit of wear and tear. Rachel O'Malley is a trauma psychologist specializing in helping victims of disasters obtain closure and heal spiritually. Her emotions are drained by assisting refugees after an Illinois flood and by her grief over her sister Jennifer, who is dying of cancer. As Rachel works to repair flood-damaged psyches and homes while exploring romance with Capt. Cole Parker, another sister, Lisa, a forensic pathologist, tries to decipher clues at a possible double murder scene. The murder weapon turns up again in a rather clich&#x201a;d Columbine-esque school shooting that improbably finds Rachel and Jennifer arriving at its onset. It's a dizzying read: the strained plot never seems fully fleshed out, and there are some odd moments, such as when Rachel and Jennifer plan a "surprise wedding" for their sister Kate. Henderson's writing can have a magical quality that keeps readers turning the pages, though, even as they're scrambling to remember the more than two dozen featured characters, their occupations and their relationships to one another. Loyal Henderson fans will likely snatch up this latest O'Malley tale, but new readers won't get the flavor for the quality of some of her previous offerings. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ghost on the Throne: The Death of Alexander the Great and the Bloody Fight for His Empire</h2><p><p>When Alexander the Great died at the age of thirty-two, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea in the west all the way to modern-day India in the east. In an unusual compromise, his two heirs&#x2014;a mentally damaged half brother, Philip III, and an infant son, Alexander IV, born after his death&#x2014;were jointly granted the kingship. But six of Alexander&#x2019;s Macedonian generals, spurred by their own thirst for power and the legend that Alexander bequeathed his rule &#x201c;to the strongest,&#x201d; fought to gain supremacy. Perhaps their most fascinating and conniving adversary was Alexander&#x2019;s former Greek secretary, Eumenes, now a general himself, who would be the determining factor in the precarious fortunes of the royal family. James Romm, professor of classics at Bard College, brings to life the cutthroat competition and the struggle for control of the Greek world&#x2019;s greatest empire.</p></p><p>"What became of Alexander's stunning accomplishments and his vision of&nbsp;&nbsp;a vast, unified empire? <i>Ghost on the Throne</i> illuminates the dark&nbsp;&nbsp;mysteries and personal motivations that swirled in the turbulent,&nbsp;&nbsp;little-studied era ushered in by Alexander's untimely death in&nbsp;&nbsp;Babylon.

In this chaotic world of teams, matrix management, and horizontal organizations, it&#39;s tougher than ever to get things done. How do you lead when you&#39;re not the one in charge? How can you be effective when joint action is needed? You need an edge in order to reach solutions and effectively work with others.</p><p>Does it seem that good ideas go nowhere at your company? That meetings are often a waste of time? That nobody seems to be in charge? Roger Fisher (the coauthor of the bestselling book <i>Getting to Yes</i>) and Alan Sharp tackle, in their book <i>Getting It Done</i>, the inertia that afflicts many groups. The authors advance the idea of lateral leadership as a means of breaking apart the logjams that inhibit effective collaboration in organizations. Lateral leadership consists of five elements: clarifying the purpose of what you're trying to accomplish; understanding how to harness the power of organized thought; learning how to integrate thinking with doing; getting yourself and your team engaged; and, finally, learning how to give feedback on what's been accomplished. This is a practical guide to solving common workplace woes that will relieve the frustrations that many of us experience everyday and at the same time help us to stand out as leaders.Alan Sharp has been a senior manager in the eletronics and chemical industries.

Mustafa Kemal Atat�rk was virtually unknown until 1919, when he took the lead in thwarting the victorious Allies' plan to partition the Turkish core of the Ottoman Empire. He divided the Allies, defeated the last Sultan, and secured the territory of the Turkish national state, becoming the first president of the new republic in 1923, fast creating his own legend. <br><br> Andrew Mango's revealing portrait of Atat�rk throws light on matters of great importance today-resurgent nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and the reality of democracy.</p><p>Andrew Mango was born in Istanbul. He wrote his first article on Turkey for the <i>Political Quarterly</i> in 1957. Since then he has published dozens of articles, as well as two general introductions to Turkey. He is the author, most recently, of <i>Turkey: The Challenge of a New Role</i> (1994).In 1923, reports Mango, a satirical magazine ran a cartoon showing the three faces of Turkey--the nation, the assembly and the government. All were identical: the features were those of Mustafa Kemal (1881-1938), an army officer who had salvaged the core of defeated Turkey after the 1914-1918 war to create a secular republic. A decade later, still trying to structure an identity for what remained of the polyglot, ramshackle Ottoman Empire, he decreed--as virtual dictator of a nation now largely populated by Muslims--that inhabitants had to take surnames. For himself, he adopted Ataturk, literally Father Turk. Mango (a retired BBC expert on Turkey and author of three previous books on the country) gives this man, one of the least-known nation-builders of the last century, full treatment, from his earliest days to his ascension to power and his death, from cirrhosis at the age of 57. Few leaders have so modernized an ancient society, instituting radical changes in dress, religion, government, education--even the alphabet. Ataturk abolished the monarchy, divided WWI's victors bent on partitioning all of Turkey, defeated rapacious Greeks intent on expanding their expatriate communities in Asia and destroyed or co-opted his domestic rivals. That so much of his legacy survives is evidence of his success. Mango's admiration for Ataturk doesn't keep him from displaying the dictator's arrogance, ruthlessness and authoritarianism; his Turkish expertise enables him to flesh out Ataturk's complex life via sources he translated himself. Mango gives a rounded, finely detailed portrait of the man who created modern Turkey. B&amp;w photos.

With fewer than one hundred guests, it was an annual celebration for Italian Americans and featured many famous actors, singers, writers, sports figures, and politicians. As I gazed around the ornate room and explored its vintage artwork and d�cor, I knew the historic mansion offered so much more to explore. <br>I walked over to the security woman who had checked us in earlier. I was about to ask her a question when she said, &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I want to thank you because you are the only person who spoke to me and asked me how my night was going when I was checking you in for the party.&#x201d; I thought, <i>I&#x2019;ve got to say something funny,</i> so I said, in my best Southern drawl, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of being in there with all those stuffy people [not really]. Is there anything else you can show this girl from Bessemer City, North Carolina, that&#x2019;s interesting and historical?&#x201d; She immediately smiled, ripped the walkie-talkie from her belt, and said into it, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bringing a guest with me to the such-and-such room.&#x201d; <br>We ventured down several long corridors until we ended up in a large, beautiful office, a magnificent space. My eyes immediately fell upon the large wooden desk that anchored the room. I had seen this wonderful image in so many photographs through the years. Little John-John Kennedy had hid under and peeked out of this desk in his father&#x2019;s office. I asked the security guard if I could please just touch it. The guard leaned toward me and whispered, &#x201c;You wanna see something really cool?&#x201d; She opened the drawer of the desk and pointed out a crude hole about four inches across. It looked as if it had been dug out with a dull screwdriver blade. Historians believe this hole housed the concealed tape recorder during some Watergate conversations; not very high-tech. It gave me chills. I asked the guard if I could go back and get my husband. I didn&#x2019;t want him to miss a chance to see this piece of history. As we walked back to the party to get him, I realized that the <i>simple</i> act of being kind and acknowledging another human being had granted me favor in the White House. <br>It&#x2019;s so important to address and respect other people in each and every situation. Other people matter. That&#x2019;s the lesson I learned in the hallowed halls of the White House. <br> <i>Have you ever been</i> introduced to someone who wouldn&#x2019;t look you in the eye? Or someone who shook your hand as if you had some sort of contagious disease? When you walked away from those encounters, how did you feel? <br>If you didn&#x2019;t feel good, you&#x2019;re not alone. <br>People want to feel that they matter. They want to be known, respected, and remembered. The better you are at making people feel that way, the more likely you are to make a good first impression. <br>Making people feel acknowledged is not a gift that you have to be born with. It&#x2019;s a skill that can be learned. You don&#x2019;t have to be an extrovert or even a people person to make a favorable first impression. Just review the simple techniques described in this chapter and practice using them as often as you can. Eventually they will become second nature and will easily be incorporated into your everyday life and interactions. <br>Just a few small changes in how you act can make a big difference. <br>THE APPROACH <br>When you&#x2019;re approaching someone to introduce yourself, walk up, extend your right hand, look the person in the eye, and say, &#x201c;Hello, I&#x2019;m ____.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s that simple. <br>Extending your hand first demonstrates self-confidence and openness, traits that make you seem both likable and competent. Technically, when it comes to workplace introductions, the higher-up should be the first to extend his or her hand. As a practical matter, however, you shouldn&#x2019;t wait too long. If the other person (even the company CEO!) doesn&#x2019;t take the lead, just get your hand out there to avoid an awkward pause. Maybe even the CEO needs a lesson in etiquette! <br>PROPER INTRODUCTIONS <br>Making a proper introduction helps enhance your business sense and can boost your self-confidence. It also demonstrates your insight and respect for others. Remember the old saying: &#x201c;You never get a second chance to make a good first impression.&#x201d; <br>Here are some guidelines to follow for a poised and professional image when making introductions. <br> Introduce people in business according to rank, not gender or age. Example: &#x201c;Dr. Mollie Marti, I would like you to meet Dr. Tom Hanson.&#x201d; <br> Be sure to look at the people you are introducing, starting with the person of greatest importance. <br> Clearly state each person&#x2019;s name to demonstrate professionalism and credibility. Try to provide a bit of information along with their names, as this can serve as a conversation starter. <br> If introducing people of equal rank, start with the older person. <br> In business, the client, guest, or visitor outranks the boss or coworker and should be introduced first. <br> When introducing someone to a family member, you should typically say the other person&#x2019;s name first. <br> In a social situation, men are generally introduced to women. Example: &#x201c;Melissa, I&#x2019;d like to introduce Bobby.&#x201d; <br>BODY LANGUAGE <br>With communication in person, body language is even more important than your words. The way you walk, stand, and move tells people a lot about you, whether you&#x2019;re aware of it or not. Every thought or feeling you have about yourself is telegraphed in your body language. <br>Think about the last party or networking event you attended. How did you decide whom to approach? What helped you figure out whether a particular person was someone you wanted to meet? <br>Chances are, you observed people&#x2019;s movements, their gestures, and their posture&#x2014;all of those nonverbal cues we rely on to help us make quick decisions in social situations. At the same time, other people were making similar observations about you. What do you think your body language was telling them? <br>Here are six simple things you can do to convey both self-confidence and respect for others without saying a word. <br> Stand up straight. When introducing yourself, stand up straight with your shoulders facing the other person. Standing tall and proud sends the message that you are confident, trustworthy, and vibrant, whereas slouching indicates that you&#x2019;re unsure of yourself and uncomfortable with your surroundings. <br> Don&#x2019;t lean on anything. When you lean, you lose 90 percent of your credibility. <br> Place your feet about six to eight inches apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. This will naturally improve your posture and make you feel steadier on your feet. Your toes should be facing the other person to avoid sending a silent signal that you want to get away. (Be aware that when you are speaking with someone and their torso and feet are not facing you, it usually means they want to get away.) <br> Stand approximately three feet away from whomever you&#x2019;re speaking with. If you stand too close, you&#x2019;re invading the other person&#x2019;s personal space (remember the &#x201c;Close Talker&#x201d; on <i>Seinfeld</i>?). On the other hand, if you stand too far away, you may make the other person feel as though you don&#x2019;t really want to be near them. <br> Make eye contact. It shows that you respect yourself and the other person, that you&#x2019;re giving your full attention to the person in front of you. If you&#x2019;re shy or have trouble making eye contact, try to focus on the color of the other person&#x2019;s eyes. If it helps you, pretend that it&#x2019;s your job to find out their eye color. You can also try looking at the person&#x2019;s forehead, right between their eyes. <br> Smile! A smile is contagious and will immediately put the other person at ease. Be careful not to overdo smiling in a professional setting, however, since you don&#x2019;t want to be perceived as frivolous or unintelligent. <br> Don&#x2019;t look over another person&#x2019;s shoulder or around the room. This will make you look easily distracted, or make the other person feel that you are not interested in what they are saying. <br>WHAT TO SAY <br>When introducing yourself in a business arena, always state your first and last name along with your title, remembering to say the client&#x2019;s name first. Example: &#x201c;Hello, Ms. Goodwin. I&#x2019;m Kelli Hadd, national VP of sales and training.&#x201d; <br>THE HANDSHAKE <br>A handshake is the only physical contact you&#x2019;re likely to have with someone you&#x2019;ve just met, so it&#x2019;s important to get it right. Fortunately, a good handshake isn&#x2019;t complicated. <br>The correct way to initiate a handshake is to extend your right arm toward the other person with your right thumb pointing up. <br>Your hands should connect &#x201c;web to web&#x201d; (the web is the portion of your hand between your thumb and forefinger). <br>The connection should be snug, but not uncomfortable, and should be followed by three up-and-down pumps. If the handshake goes beyond three pumps, let the other person end the shake when they want to. As long as the other person is still pumping, it&#x2019;s important not to yank your hand away even if the other person&#x2019;s hand is sweaty. Pulling your hand away before the other person is ready will come across as a rejection, and nobody likes to feel rejected. <br>If you try to initiate a handshake, but the other person doesn&#x2019;t respond, don&#x2019;t worry about it. Stay relaxed, lower your hand, maintain eye contact, and continue talking. <br>Never shake hands while in a seated or subservient position. Stand up, then shake hands; this applies to women as well. If a barrier is between you and the other person, such as a desk or table, then come around from behind the barrier for the handshake, never lean across it. <br>Although a good handshake is simple, you can easily make a small mistake that conveys a bad impression. Here are a few types of handshakes you should avoid at all costs. <br> The <i>limp fish.</i> This is when your hand is limp and feels to the other person as if it has no bones (not a good feeling). Rather than grasping the other person&#x2019;s hand, you&#x2019;re making him or her do all the work. This type of handshake says to the other person, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m weak; I don&#x2019;t believe in myself; I&#x2019;m not a winner.&#x201d; To avoid a limp fish handshake, grasp the other person&#x2019;s hand firmly and maintain a snug connection. If someone gives you a limp fish, try to push your hand in a little closer to get a better connection. <br> The <i>bone crusher.</i> The bone crusher is the opposite of the limp fish handshake. It&#x2019;s when you squeeze the other person&#x2019;s hand so firmly that it causes pain or discomfort. This type of handshake tells people that you&#x2019;re anxious and need to dominate others to feel powerful. <br> The <i>queen&#x2019;s shake.</i> This is when you hold on to someone&#x2019;s fingertips, instead of making palm-to-palm contact. This type of handshake makes other people feel that you don&#x2019;t want to touch them and conveys an &#x201c;I&#x2019;m better than you&#x201d; attitude. <br> The <i>wrestler.</i> The wrestler handshake is when you turn the other person&#x2019;s hand over so that your hand is on top. It is an aggressive and blatant show of power. If someone uses a wrestler shake with you, correct it by taking a two-inch step to the left while gradually returning your hand to a vertical position. This will help restore the balance of power. <br> The <i>double handshake.</i> This is when you use two hands. Your right hand grasps the other person&#x2019;s as in a correct handshake, but your left hand is placed on top of theirs. This handshake should only be used in intimate situations, such as to convey condolences. It tells the other person that you&#x2019;re feeling for them, but if used in the wrong situation, it feels insincere and inappropriate. <br> The <i>fist bump.</i> This is technically a handshake substitute rather than a type of handshake, but President Barack Obama&#x2019;s use of it has made it acceptable in certain situations. It is most appropriate when used by close friends as a celebratory or congratulatory gesture, so don&#x2019;t try it at your next board meeting, unless the CEO initiates it. <br>Some germaphobes have begun using the fist bump to avoid handshakes; they believe it to be more sanitary. Since you never know if this is what&#x2019;s going on, if someone initiates a fist bump with you, just go along with it. However, since it is still not generally accepted as an appropriate substitute for a handshake, I recommend against initiating a fist bump in most situations. <br>One last little tip: if you tend to have sweaty hands, use cornstarch or powder or spray antiperspirant on your hands before social events. This will help keep your palms dry so you can shake hands with confidence. <br>Also, modern etiquette dictates that in social situations a man or a woman can initiate a handshake. It is no longer customary for an elderly woman to initiate a handshake with a younger woman or a gentleman with a lady. Be mindful, with elderly men or women, it might be wise to pause and let them reach out, as they may have arthritis. <br>In business, the higher-ranked person should extend their hand, but if they don&#x2019;t, it is wise to go ahead and initiate the handshake. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2011 by Patricia Rossi <br></p><h2>Fight Cancer with a Ketogenic Diet, Third Edition: Using a Low-Carb, Fat-Burning Diet as Metabolic Therapy</h2><p><p>The ketogenic diet is a natural, nontoxic metabolic therapy being studied and utilized for cancer prevention and treatment. It works because cancer cells are dependent upon a constant supply of blood sugar (glucose) to stay alive. Normal cells can make energy from both glucose and ketones (metabolic by-products of burning fat), but most cancer cells can only use glucose. Avoiding carbohydrates (starch and sugar) while enjoying delicious and healthy protein and fats will lower blood glucose and increase blood-ketone levels, resulting in a normal body state called nutritional ketosis. Research has shown that nutritional ketosis starves cancer cells while nourishing normal cells and strengthening total body health.</p><p>This essential, fully referenced book is a practical guide for physicians, patients and caregivers, and provides step-by-step instructions for customizing the diet and clear explanations of the cutting-edge research on ketogenic therapies being done by Dr. Dominic D&#x2019;Agostino&#x2019;s team at the University of South Florida and Dr. Thomas Seyfried&#x2019;s team at Boston College. The ketogenic diet for cancer is based on the consumption of whole, fresh foods and it can be used in addition to standard care or as a stand-alone treatment in wait-and-see situations.</p><p>Fight Cancer with a Ketogenic Diet, Third Edition offers 150 pages of the latest information on the newest research and complementary therapies, and includes:</p><p>� how and why a low carb, ketogenic diet works to stop cancer cells � how to implement the diet and how to monitor your progress � blood glucose and ketone level targets recommended to destroy cancer � what foods to choose and how much to eat � why certain foods must be restricted � use of calorie restriction and fasting � whether alcohol is allowed � the debate between acidity vs alkalinity � appropriate supplementation and much more.</p><p>The first edition of this book was released in 2012 and was the first book written to help the patient. It has been updated as the research has developed, and the body of scientific evidence continues to grow. Metabolic therapy is cutting edge, and thousands of people have purchased and used the information in this book to take back some control over their own health. You can too.</p></p><p>Ellen Davis, MS, is an expert on ketogenic nutrition and is an accomplished author and alternative-health advocate.

Ratchet is on a train to Maine for a summer with relatives within the blink of an eye. But these aren't just any relatives. Ratchet's ninety-two-year old great-aunts, twins Penpen and Tilly, live life in their secluded home on their own terms. They were born together, they grew up together, they live together, and they plan to die together. Through thick wilderness, down forgotten, bear-ridden roads, a plethora of strange family history, and a slew of unwelcome guests, Ratchet may just learn what a family can be after all. Unwelcome guests might just bring the greatest gifts of all. </p><p>By turns dark and humorous, Polly Horvath offers readers enough quirky characters and outrageous situations to leave them reeling!</p></p><p>As in Roald Dahl's <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>, Polly Horvath tells the story of an abandoned child who is sent to live with two distant relatives in a big, lonely house. The magic in Horvath's story, however, lies not in talking bugs but in the hearts and minds of its characters. Thirteen-year-old Ratchet Clark, a girl with a deformity on her shoulder blade her breezily cruel, self-absorbed mother calls "That Thing," is unceremoniously kicked out for the summer while her mom attends to important things, like how to gain entry into the prestigious Pensacola country club. Mom drops Ratchet off at her great second-cousins' enormous, turreted house in Maine, a remote seaside estate surrounded by oily blueberry bogs and bears.<p> What starts out as a fairly grim proposition transforms as Ratchet befriends the endearing, downright hilarious 91-year-old twins Aunt Tilly and Aunt Penpen who are "as different as chalk and cheese" and learns the ways of rural Maine. When another unwanted teenage girl named Harper ("obnoxious, but strangely compelling") enters the scene, the household dynamic changes yet again. Though fairytale-like in its setting and its charm, do not be fooled. Suicide, decapitation, wretched mothers, and a sprinkling of profanity pepper this poignant, philosophical, darkly humorous novel that dips into subjects from technology to love to death. In Horvath's capable hands, readers are left believing in the best of human nature as she switches effortlessly from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again. Wild stories, brilliant dialogue, and vats of compassion distinguish Newbery Honor author Horvath's latest offering.

He reminds us that we are made for&nbsp;happiness.&nbsp;But he goes beyond that, showing us the path to&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;happiness. It&#x2019;s not a new path. In fact, Jesus showed us the way in the Beatitudes, but&nbsp;Kingdom of Happiness&nbsp;reveals how these aren&#x2019;t merely nice sayings, they are powerful ways of&nbsp;living.<br><br> Fr. Kirby first identifies the sources of unhappiness: the false promises&#x2014;the anti-beatitudes&#x2014;of a fallen, busy world. He explains how these anti-beatitudes, far from leading to happiness, tear down and rob us of&nbsp;happiness. Kirby leads the reader out of this darkness, pointing us to Jesus Christ as the saint-tested and centuries-proven source of authentic peace, true joy, and radical&nbsp;happiness.<br><br> To unveil the path to&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;in Jesus Christ, Kirby does not rely on emotional arguments or soft spirituality. He turns to the boldness of the Lord&#x2019;s Beatitudes, the real promises to true&nbsp;happiness. He teaches about the love, power, and self-control within them by showing their practical, life-application in today&#x2019;s world.&nbsp;<br><br> Kingdom of Happiness&nbsp;shows that the Beatitudes are not a self-help guide or a boring list of eight more things to do, but are a series of grace-filled, life-giving promises that excite our souls and point us along a way of life that assures us of true, lasting&nbsp;happiness.</p><p>Father Jeffrey Kirby was ordained into the priesthood on July 27th, 2007. He received his Masters in Bioethics from Queen of the Apostles in Rome, and his Masters of Arts in Philosophy from Franciscan University where he graduated summa cum laude. Since 2010, he has been the Vicar of Vocations for the Diocese of Charleston where he has guided numerous young men and women in the spiritual life and in the process of discernment.

Professor Eliach spent 15 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in her quest to document the lives of almost everyone who was killed in her childhood shtetl. She did this by collecting photographs, diaries, and letters while traveling to all 50 states and a number of foreign countries.

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New Mexico.Woods's violent but involving thriller about a father's attempts to retrieve his kidnapped daughter from the clutches of a merciless drug kingpin is thankfully relieved by pleasant interludes at lavish South American hotels, often poolside, and by a little romance. L.J. Ganser's fluid, energetic voice smoothly handles these shifts in tone, effectively conveying both the gritty action and the lighter moments. His vocal characterizations are varied and interesting, and his delivery makes the most of some surprising plot developments. As "Cat" Catledge and his small band of allies navigate the dark underbelly of Colombia and the dangers of the Amazon jungle in search of his missing daughter, Ganser does an able job of making us root for the good guys.

With its architecture, palm trees, and cobblestone streets, Charleston is one of the South&#x2019;s great cultural destinations. Its ballrooms and benevolent society halls attest to grand periods of opulence and high living. The theater, libraries, museum, and college show an appreciation for culture and sophistication. But don&#x2019;t let the city&#x2019;s beauty hide its turbulent history. The horrors of bombardment and occupation by conquering armies have left their marks. The city has experienced bleak times and disasters, including fires, a devastating earthquake, and hurricanes, not to mention the challenges of Reconstruction. Yet Charleston has survived its darker days, and now may be the city&#x2019;s finest hour. Neighborhoods from Calhoun Street to the Battery are in better condition today than they have ever been before. This book offers three tours to explore the historic downtown: the Meeting Street loop, the Legare Street loop, and the Ansonborough tour. Enjoy the walk, and let the city tell you its story.</p><p>Author Mary Preston Foster moved to Charleston in the 1960s, when single schoolteachers often rented rooms and carriage houses on Church Street and South Battery.

Otherwise what was it all for?&#x201d;</em></p><p>In 2006, after his father was killed, Gulwali Passarlay was caught between the Taliban who wanted to recruit him, and the Americans who wanted to use him. To protect her son, Gulwali&#x2019;s mother sent him away. The search for safety would lead the twelve-year-old across eight countries, from the mountains of eastern Afghanistan through Iran and Europe to Britain. Over the course of twelve harrowing months, Gulwali endured imprisonment, hunger, cruelty, brutality, loneliness, and terror&#x2014;and nearly drowned crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Eventually granted asylum in England, Gulwali was sent to a good school, learned English, won a place at a top university, and was chosen to help carry the Olympic Torch in the 2012 London Games.</p><p>In <em>The Lightless Sky</em>, Gulwali recalls his remarkable experience and offers a firsthand look at one of the most pressing issues of our time: the modern refugee crisis&#x2014;the worst displacement of millions of men, women, and children in generations. Few, like Gulwali, make it to a country that offers the chance of freedom and opportunity. A celebration of courage and determination, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is a poignant account of an exceptional human being who is today an ardent advocate of democracy&#x2014;and a reminder of our responsibilities to those caught in terrifying and often deadly circumstances beyond their control.</p></p><p><p>After his father and grandfather were killed by U.S. troops for allegedly cooperating with the Taliban, Gulwali Passarlay fled Afghanistan with his brother in the middle of the night, with only a hastily packed rucksack and little more than 200 dollars in his pocket. He was twelve years old, and this is his story. </p><p>The first book to tell the modern refugee crisis from a firsthand perspective, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is an unforgettable chronicle of Gulwali&#x2019;s yearlong odyssey from Afghanistan to England, during which he traveled more than 12,000 miles, escaped internment in Turkey and Bulgaria, and negotiated passage with shadowy agents in the smuggling trade. Told in unflinching and memorable detail, <em>The Lightless Sky</em> is at once an utterly absorbing personal history and a stunning testament to the power of the human spirit; the triumph of faith, courage, and determination; and the undeniable universal right to life, liberty, and security of person.</p><p>Gulwali Passarlay was sent away from Afghanistan as a young boy, fleeing the conflict that had claimed his father&#x2019;s life. After an extraordinarily tortuous journey across eight countries, Gulwali arrived in the United Kingdom a year later and has most recently devoted his new life to education. Now twenty-one years old, he is set to graduate from the University of Manchester with a degree in politics. Gulwali is a member of many prestigious political, aid, and youth groups, each a stepping-stone to his ultimate goal: to run for the presidency of Afghanistan.</p></p><h2>The Beatles: On The Road 1964-1966</h2><p><p>In early 1964, photographer Harry Benson received a call from the photo editor of London&#x2019;s Daily Express, who asked him to cover the Beatles&#x2019; trip to Paris. It was the beginning of a career-defining relationship, which would both make Benson&#x2019;s name and produce some of the most intimate photographs ever taken of the Beatles.</p><p>In Paris, Benson captured the Fab Four in the midst of a pillow fight at the George V Hotel, a spontaneous moment which came to epitomize the spirit of the band&#x2015;Benson himself has called it the best shot of his career. Later that year, he followed the group on the road for their debut U.S. tour, documenting their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, their surprising encounter with Cassius Clay, and the hysteria of New York Beatlemania. Benson also photographed George Harrison&#x2019;s honeymoon in Barbados, documented the Beatles on the set of their debut movie A Hard Day&#x2019;s Night, and was present on the now infamous 1966 tour when John Lennon said that the Beatles were &#x201c;more popular than Jesus.&#x201d;Previously out-of-print, this re-edition brings back the best of Benson&#x2019;s luminous black-and-white Beatles portfolio. Complemented by quotes and newspaper clippings from the period, an introduction by the photographer himself adds exciting personal testimony to these iconic images of the greatest band in musical history.</p></p><p>Glasgow-born Harry Benson has photographed every US President since Eisenhower, the Civil Rights movement, and was next to Robert Kennedy when he was assassinated. As well as The Beatles, he has shot some of the biggest personalities of the last 50 years, including Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor and Her Majesty The Queen. In 2009, he was made Commander of the British Empire (CBE).&#34;These photos convey a really happy period for them and for me. It all comes down to music, they were without a doubt the greatest band of the 20th century, and that&#39;s why these photographs are so important.&#34; (Harry Benson, 2012)&#34;</p><h2>Threads of the Past: Stories of Pioneer Women and Their Quilts</h2><p>Inspired by the author&#39;s immigrant ancestors, this is an intimate account of seven unforgettable women surviving extraordinary challenges and hardships in their new homes in America. These brave pioneer women express their dreams and losses and their joys and heartbreaks in the form of letters, diaries and other writings based on extensive genealogy research, documented facts and historical events. Spanning a time period from 1857 to 1939, their immigration and life stories are at the same time heartbreaking and heartwarming. Sophia&#39;s family faces the dangers of the raw frontier of Minnesota, and they must flee for their very lives during the Sioux Uprising of 1862. Her sons later serve in the Civil War with tragic consequences. Her daughter Louisa tells a coming-of-age story and makes a surprising marriage, but struggles to keep her faith alive amidst terrible losses. Henrietta suffers the hardships of homesteading and living in a sod house to ensure that her three sons will never go hungry. Albertina goes kicking and screaming from a good life in Germany to a lonely life on the open prairies, with her family unfortunately arriving in Minnesota at the same time as the grasshopper plagues. Faced with a life of shame in Bohemia, Magdalena risks an arranged marriage to a man in America. She loves having child after child, but is devastated by the deaths of many of them. Carolina dutifully follows her husband&#39;s dream and raises her family in a tiny log cabin on the harsh frontier. She feels blessed to have not lost any of her ten children, but tragedies strike later in life. Eliza, with a strong independent personality and known as a &#34;hard woman&#34;, details her family&#39;s immigration from Germany to Minnesota, their daily lives, and the hardships of the Great Depression. The history and evolution of quilting in America from pre-Civil War times through the 1930s is intertwined throughout these stories, with special quilts representing the patterns and fabrics from each era. Threads of the Past is beautifully illustrated with over one hundred wonderful vintage photos and ephemera. The life stories of these courageous women are at the same time harrowing and hopeful, heartbreaking and uplifting, but always grounded in faith and love of family.</p><p>Lanie Tiffenbach is a native of Minnesota and grew up in the area where her immigrant ancestors had settled some generations earlier and where many of the events mentioned in this book occurred. Interesting facts and rich family lore uncovered in her meticulous genealogical and historical research inspired her to tell the stories of her women ancestors. Lanie is also an avid quilter, and for this book she chose quilts from her own collection of antique quilts, as well as quilts she has made with vintage or reproduction fabrics and patterns from earlier times. Lanie Tiffenbach currently lives in the Denver, Colorado, area with her husband and has two adult sons and one precious granddaughter.</p><h2>Spelunky (Boss Fight Books)</h2><p>When Derek Yu released Spelunky for free in 2008, his roguelike-inspired platformer took the indie game community by storm with its combination of classic platform mechanics, extreme difficulty, and random level generation.

She acknowledges right away that she's not a conventional mother, that she and her son Jason don't have a traditional home life. She was seventeen when Jason was born and they spent eight of the next ten years on welfare. A spunky, spirited woman with a defiant streak, she wages a constant struggle with herself: is Jason an anchor pulling her down or does he provide ballast? At times he seems to grow in spite of her. Her love for him isn't in question, but will she ever be able to comprehend his needs? Motherhood is never easy, but hers was made more difficult by a society ready to cast judgment on young, single mothers, by a family who finds it easier to criticize than support her, and her own struggle to reach a long held dream of a college education. As Beverly's sense of self increases and she realizes her goals, Jason challenges and contributes to her understanding of life and their growth together. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Holly Smith</i></p><h2>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study: An Insider&#39;s Account of the Shocking Medical Experiment Conducted by Government Doctors Against African American Men</h2><p>In 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service recruited 623 African American men from Macon County, Alabama, for a study of &#x201c;the effects of untreated syphilis in the Negro male.&#x201d; For the next 40 years&#x2015;even after the development of penicillin, the cure for syphilis&#x2015;these men were denied medical care for this potentially fatal disease.

Torrance has been called "the greatest Reformed theologian since Karl Barth" and "the greatest British theologian of the twentieth century" by prominent voices in the academy. His work has profoundly shaped contemporary theology in the English-speaking world. This first of two volumes comprises Thomas Torrance's lectures delivered to students in Christian Dogmatics on Christology at New College, Edinburgh, from 1952 to 1978 and amounts to the most comprehensive presentation of Torrance's understanding of the incarnation ever published. In eight chapters these expertly edited lectures highlight Torrance's distinctive belief that the object of our theological study&#x2015;Jesus Christ&#x2015;actively gives himself to us in order that we may know him. They also unpack Torrance's well-developed understanding of our union with Christ and how it impacts the Christian life, as well as his reflections on the in-breaking of Christ's kingdom and its intense conflict with and victory over evil. Decidedly readable and filled with some of Torrance's most influential thought, this will be an important volume for scholars, professors and students of Christian theology for decades to come.</p><p>&#34;No theologian in the latter half of the twentieth century devoted more attention to the mystery of the incarnation than T. F. Torrance. These magnificent posthumously published lectures give us the most sustained and rounded account of his views that we will ever have. In depth of learning, profundity of insight and purity of faith, nothing comparable has appeared from the pen of an English-speaking theologian since John Henry Newman.

Eisenhower gave his famous warning about the dangers of the military-industrial complex, he never would have dreamed that a single company could accumulate the kind of power and influence that is now wielded by Lockheed Martin. As a full-service weapons maker, Lockheed Martin receives over 29 billion a year in Pentagon contracts, or roughly one out of every ten dollars the Department of Defense doles out to private contractors. <i>Prophets of War</i> recounts the fascinating and often-frightening history of America's largest military contractor as well as its role in the formation of foreign policy.<p>The company has produced spy satellites; helped the Pentagon collect personal data on U.S. citizens; provided interrogators for employment at Guantanamo Bay; manufactured our highest-tech aircraft; and more. It has also been embroiled in numerous scandals &#x2014; from bribing officials in the Netherlands, Italy, and Japan in exchange for the purchase of Lockheed airplanes in the 1970s, to the provision of 600 toilet covers and 7,000 coffee makers to the Pentagon in the 1980s.</p><p>William D. Hartung's enthralling expos� chronicles the growth of Lockheed Martin into one of the most influential corporations in the world, and examines the pivotal role the company has had in America's metastasizing military industrial complex. It asks: How has one company become the recipient of such a large portion of America's tax dollars through contracts with the Pentagon, NASA, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, the NSA, and even the U.S. Census and the IRS? Hartung's meticulous, hard-hitting history follows Lockheed Martin's meteoric growth and unravels how this arms industry giant has helped shape U.S. foreign policy for decades.</p></p><p><b>Bill Hartung</b> is the director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation. He has worked for the Council on Economic Priorities and the World Policy Institute doing research and writing on the arms industry and the politics of defense spending. Hartung is the author of two books on the intersection between the arms industry and the shaping of U.S. foreign policy, <i>And Weapons for All</i> and <i>How Much Are You Making on the War, Daddy? &#x2013; A Quick and Dirty Guide to War Profiteering in the Bush Administration.</i><p>Hartung has written for The <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The Nation</i>, and has been interviewed by ABC News, CBS 60 Minutes, CNN, Fox News, the Lehrer Newshour, NBC Nightly News, and National Public Radio. His writing on Lockheed Martin has appeared in the <i>Washington Post</i> Outlook section, <i>The Nation</i>, the <i>Multinational Monitor</i>, and the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>. He lives in New York City.</p>Corporate clout, military innovation, and political influence make an uneasy mix in this smart and thorough corporate history of Lockheed Martin's emergence as the nation's largest weapons contractor. Hartung (And Weapons for All) traces the company's rise from unimpressive military aircraft manufacturer in WWI through its emergence as a major supplier of fighters and bombers for the Allies in WWII to corporate behemoth and power player in setting American foreign policy. The author explores how deeply Lockheed's tentacles have penetrated American economic and political life, pulling the curtain back on decades of unsavory dealings: Lockheed's decision to sell airplanes to Japan in the late 1930s (they were later converted to military use); reports of widespread bribery of foreign executives and politicians; and vengeful retribution against Pentagon whistleblowers. Hartung reveals how the company's adaptability has helped it survive--and expand--even as its reputation became tarnished, and echoes President Eisenhower's argument that the only way to ensure against "military-industrial" abuses is to have "an alert and engaged citizenry." This book is a fine step in that direction. (Jan.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton&#39;s Last Night a DJ Saved My Life was the definitive history of the DJ. Now they gather their mastery of the artistic and technical aspects of being a DJ into a clear, accessible, and entertaining guide. How to DJ is the perfect guide -- from the most basic keys to establishing a music collection and a distinctive sound, to elementary record-spinning, to the complex skills of scratching, hot-mixing, and beat-juggling, as well as the inimitable art of creating an evening of sound that is perfectly timed, balanced, and unforgettable. Diagrams throughout illustrate phrases, beat timing, and song structure with no reliance on music theory, and resource lists recommend everything from which songs are best (and most fun) to learn with, to good sources for building a library of disks, CDs, and MP3s. For those who want to turn pro, the authors give sage advice on the vagaries of the club and music business. Short quotes, anecdotes, and photos of famous DJs such as Grandmaster Flash and Derrick Carter are featured.</p><p></p><h2>Yoga Biomechanics: Stretching Redefined</h2><p>The book gives teachers a grounding in biomechanics so that they can easily use yoga and/or stretching with their students. Most yoga teacher schools provide only limited training in anatomy and biomechanics, and the study of the effect of mechanical forces on structure and function is often overlooked and/or misunderstood. Aesthetic cues (i.e. instructing students where to place their hands and feet in yoga asana) may not be biomechanically appropriate for everyone. Readers will learn to fit the pose to the student, rather than making the student fit the pose<br><br>This book:<br><br>* Highlights useful, evidence-based applications and examples of yoga and/or stretching.<br>* Provides insight into critical interpretation of research findings helping the reader to avoid clinical assumptions.<br>* Encourages variety in popular modern day asana, using yoga props and a keen eye, based on the understanding of how tissues adapt to applied loads.<br>* Educates yoga teachers to think beyond common scripted yoga education.<br>* Supports teachers to understand biomechanics, rather than simply memorizing anatomy, empowering them to make smart choices for instructing a variety of populations in both private and group class settings.</p><p></p><h2>Kinesiology for Occupational Therapy</h2><p><b><i>Kinesiology for Occupational Therapy, Third Edition</i></b> covers the theoretical background for understanding the kinematics and kinetics of normal human physiological movement.

She was a tall woman with long red hair that she bundled into a sort of net behind her head, and she was twisting her hands together nervously as if there was something she didn&#x2019;t want to have to say or something she didn&#x2019;t want to have to believe.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Mother,&#x2019; said Bruno, marching towards her, &#x2018;what&#x2019;s going on? Why is Maria going through my things?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s packing them,&#x2019; explained Mother.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Packing them?&#x2019; he asked, running quickly through the events of the previous few days to consider whether he&#x2019;d been particularly naughty or had used those words out loud that he wasn&#x2019; t allowed to use and was being sent away because of it. He couldn&#x2019;t think of anything though. In fact over the last few days he had behaved in a perfectly decent manner to everyone and couldn&#x2019;t remember causing any chaos at all. &#x2018;Why?&#x2019; he asked then. &#x2018;What have I done?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars, the butler, was in there, packing her things too. She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before march-ing back to the staircase, followed by Bruno, who wasn&#x2019;t going to let the matter drop without an explanation.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Mother,&#x2019; he insisted. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s going on? Are we moving?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Come downstairs with me,&#x2019; said Mother, leading the way towards the large dining room where the Fury had been to dinner the week before. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ll talk down there.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived. He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she couldn&#x2019; t have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual, like his own after he&#x2019;d been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Now, you don&#x2019;t have to worry, Bruno,&#x2019; said Mother, sitting down in the chair where the beautiful blonde woman who had come to dinner with the Fury had sat and waved at him when Father closed the doors. &#x2018;In fact if anything it&#x2019;s going to be a great adventure.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;What is?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Am I being sent away?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;No, not just you,&#x2019; she said, looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it. &#x2018;We all are. Your father and I, Gretel and you. All four of us.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno thought about this and frowned. He wasn&#x2019;t particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him. But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;But where?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Where are we going exactly? Why can&#x2019;t we stay here?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Your father&#x2019;s job,&#x2019; explained Mother. &#x2018;You know how important it is, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, of course,&#x2019; said Bruno, nodding his head, because there were always so many visitors to the house &#x2014; men in fantastic uniforms, women with typewriters that he had to keep his mucky hands off &#x2014; and they were always very polite to Father and told each other that he was a man to watch and that the Fury had big things in mind for him.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, sometimes when someone is very important,&#x2019; continued Mother, &#x2018;the man who employs him asks him to go somewhere else because there&#x2019;s a very special job that needs doing there.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;What kind of job?&#x2019; asked Bruno, because if he was honest with himself &#x2014; which he always tried to be &#x2014; he wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure what job Father did.&nbsp;<br><br>In school they had talked about their fathers one day and Karl had said that his father was a greengrocer, which Bruno knew to be true because he ran the greengrocer&#x2019;s shop in the centre of town. And Daniel had said that his father was a teacher, which Bruno knew to be true because he taught the big boys who it was always wise to steer clear of. And Martin had said that his father was a chef, which Bruno knew to be true because he sometimes collected Martin from school and when he did he always wore a white smock and a tartan apron, as if he&#x2019;d just stepped out of his kitchen.&nbsp;<br><br>But when they asked Bruno what his father did he opened his mouth to tell them, then realized that he didn&#x2019;t know himself. All he could say was that his father was a man to watch and that the Fury had big things in mind for him. Oh, and that he had a fantastic uniform too.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a very important job,&#x2019; said Mother, hesitating for a moment. &#x2018;A job that needs a very special man to do it. You can understand that, can&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And we all have to go too?&#x2019; asked Bruno.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Of course we do,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;You wouldn&#x2019;t want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there, would you?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I suppose not,&#x2019; said Bruno.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Father would miss us all terribly if we weren&#x2019; t with him,&#x2019; she added.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Who would he miss the most?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;Me or Gretel?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;He would miss you both equally,&#x2019; said Mother, for she was a great believer in not play-ing favourites, which Bruno respected, especially since he knew that he was her favourite really.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;But what about our house?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;Who&#x2019;s going to take care of it while we&#x2019;re gone?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again. It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total, if you included the basement, where Cook made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table argu-ing with each other and calling each other names that you weren&#x2019;t supposed to use. And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held on to the frame tightly.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;We have to close up the house for now,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;But we&#x2019;ll come back to it someday.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And what about Cook?&#x2019; asked Bruno. &#x2018;And Lars? And Maria? Are they not going to live in it?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming with us,&#x2019; explained Mother. &#x2018;But that&#x2019;s enough questions for now. Maybe you should go upstairs and help Maria with your packing.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno stood up from the seat but didn&#x2019;t go anywhere. There were just a few more questions he needed to put to her before he could allow the matter to be settled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;And how far away is it?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;The new job, I mean. Is it further than a mile away?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh my,&#x2019; said Mother with a laugh, although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didn&#x2019;t look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didn&#x2019;t want him to see her face. &#x2018;Yes, Bruno,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s more than a mile away. Quite a lot more than that, in fact.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno&#x2019; s eyes opened wide and his mouth made the shape of an O. He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re leaving Berlin?&#x2019; he asked, gasping for air as he got the words out.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x2019; said Mother, nodding her head sadly. &#x2018;Your father&#x2019;s job is&#x2013;&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;But what about school?&#x2019; said Bruno, inter-rupting her, a thing he knew he was not supposed to do but which he felt he would be forgiven for on this occasion. &#x2018;And what about Karl and Daniel and Martin? How will they know where I am when we want to do things together?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ll have to say goodbye to your friends for the time being,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;Although I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll see them again in time. And don&#x2019;t interrupt your mother when she&#x2019;s talking, please,&#x2019; she added, for although this was strange and unpleasant news, there was certainly no need for Bruno to break the rules of politeness which he had been taught.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Say goodbye to them?&#x2019; he asked, staring at her in surprise. &#x2018;Say goodbye to them?&#x2019; he repeated, spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he&#x2019;d munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet. &#x2018;Say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin?&#x2019; he continued, his voice coming dangerously close to shouting, which was not allowed indoors. &#x2018;But they&#x2019;re my three best friends for life!&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;ll make other friends,&#x2019; said Mother, waving her hand in the air dismissively, as if the making of a boy&#x2019;s three best friends for life was an easy thing.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;But we had plans,&#x2019; he protested.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Plans?&#x2019; asked Mother, raising an eyebrow. &#x2018;What sort of plans?&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, that would be telling,&#x2019; said Bruno, who could not reveal the exact nature of the plans &#x2014; which included causing a lot of chaos, especially in a few weeks&#x2019; time when school finished for the summer holidays and they didn&#x2019;t have to spend all their time just making plans but could actually put them into effect instead.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, Bruno,&#x2019; said Mother, &#x2018;but your plans are just going to have to wait. We don&#x2019;t have a choice in this.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;But, Mother!&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Bruno, that&#x2019;s enough,&#x2019; she said, snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough. &#x2018;Honestly, only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, I don&#x2019;t like the way we have to turn all the lights off at night now,&#x2019; he admitted.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x2018;Everyone has to do that,&#x2019; said Mother. &#x2018;It keeps us safe. And who knows, maybe we&#x2019;ll be in less danger if we move away. Now, I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing. We don&#x2019;t have as much time to prepare as I would have liked, thanks to some people.&#x2019;&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno nodded and walked away sadly, know-ing that &#x2018;some people&#x2019; was a grown-up&#x2019;s word for &#x2018;Father&#x2019; and one that he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to use himself.&nbsp;<br><br>He made his way up the stairs slowly, holding on to the banister with one hand, and wondered whether the new house in the new place where the new job was would have as fine a banister to slide down as this one did. For the banister in this house stretched from the very top floor &#x2014; just outside the little room where, if he stood on his tiptoes and held on to the frame of the window tightly, he could see right across Berlin &#x2014; to the ground floor, just in front of the two enormous oak doors. And Bruno liked nothing better than to get on board the banister at the top floor and slide his way through the house, making whooshing sounds as he went.&nbsp;<br><br>Down from the top floor to the next one, where Mother and Father&#x2019;s room was, and the large bathroom, and where he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be in any case.&nbsp;<br><br>Down to the next floor, where his own room was, and Gretel&#x2019;s room too, and the smaller bath-room which he was supposed to use more often than he really did.<br><br>Down to the ground floor, where you fell off the end of the banister and had to land flat on your two feet or it was five points against you and you had to start all over again.&nbsp;<br><br>The banister was the best thing about this house &#x2014; that and the fact that Grandfather and Grandmother lived so near by &#x2014; and when he thought about that it made him wonder whether they were coming to the new job too and he presumed that they were because they could hardly be left behind. No one needed Gretel much because she was a Hopeless Case &#x2014; it would be a lot easier if she stayed to look after the house &#x2014; but Grandfather and Grandmother? Well, that was an entirely different matter.&nbsp;<br><br>Bruno went up the stairs slowly towards his room, but before going inside he looked back down towards the ground floor and saw Mother entering Father&#x2019;s office, which faced the dining room &#x2014; and was Out Of Bounds At All Times And No Exceptions &#x2014; and he heard her speaking loudly to him until Father spoke louder than Mother could and that put a stop to their conversation. Then the door of the office closed and Bruno couldn&#x2019;t hear any more so he thought it would be a good idea if he went back to his room and took over the packing from Maria, because otherwise she might pull all his belongings out of the wardrobe without any care or consideration, even the things he&#x2019;d hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else&#x2019;s business.</p><h2>Holiday Jubilee: Classic &amp; Kitschy Festivities &amp; Fun Party Recipes</h2><p>You're invited to celebrate America&#x2019;s favorite seasonal traditions like never before.

And yet, no matter how hard I tried, I seemed to fall back into the same ruts and defeating patterns over and over again. The Bible said I was a &#x201c;new creation&#x201d; (2 Corinthians 5:17), and yet I felt stuck in the &#x201c;old,&#x201d; repeating the same sinful behaviors I&#x2019;d repented of the day before. <i>Will I ever be what God wants me to be? </i>I wondered.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this study, we&#x2019;re going to walk toward Christlikeness together, but let me be clear.

In this dazzling biography, Elizabeth Lev illuminates her extraordinary life and accomplishments.<br><br>Raised in the court of Milan and wed at age ten to the pope&#x2019;s corrupt nephew, Caterina was ensnared in Italy&#x2019;s political intrigues early in life. After turbulent years in Rome&#x2019;s papal court, she moved to the Romagnol province of Forl�. Following her husband&#x2019;s assassination, she ruled Italy&#x2019;s crossroads with iron will, martial strength, political savvy, and an icon&#x2019;s fashion sense. In finally losing her lands to the Borgia family, she put up a resistance that inspired all of Europe and set the stage for her progeny&#x2014;including Cosimo de&#x2019; Medici&#x2014;to follow her example to greatness.<br><br>A rich evocation of Renaissance life, <i>The Tigress of Forl�</i> reveals Caterina Riario Sforza as a brilliant and fearless ruler, and a tragic but unbowed figure.<br><br>&#x201c;A rich, nuanced portrait of a highly controversial beauty and military leader, and her violent, albeit glittering, Italian Renaissance milieu.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Well-written and meticulously researched, The Tigress of Forl� recreates the world of Renaissance Italy in all its grandeur and violence.

Streets and shops were named for her and clearly she was a big deal in this small town. But when I ran into her portrait in the Uffizi gallery in Florence as grandmother of the first Medici duke and then in the Sistine Chapel under Michelangelo&#x2019;s famous ceiling, I began to realize she was a much more than just a local idol. Then, while reading a book on the history of the Medici family I read a little sketch of her life and I was hooked.</p> <br><strong>Q:What were the challenges involved in writing this book?</strong> <br> <p><strong>A:</strong>After 20 years in Italy, I thought my Italian was pretty good, but reading documents in various Italian dialects was definitely challenging. During the four years of research and writing, I got used to the way Renaissance Romans spelled, and learned idiomatic phrases from 15th-century Romagna. It was fun&#x2014;like standing in a town square 500 years ago listening to all the gossip, stories, and news, and even the occasional weather report!</p> <p><strong>Q:How do you see Caterina as relating to contemporary women?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Caterina amazes me, because she resembles a 21st-century go-getter, multitasking woman, in a world where that was not considered an admirable quality. She ran a business, raised eight children, ruled two towns, fought off assassins, had steamy love affairs, and even had her own cosmetics line! All this in 46 years of life! In our age we love to see people who are passionate about what they do, in her age restraint was the highest virtue.

I wondered why there weren&#x2019;t stacks of biographies as there are for other celebrated women. When I got midway through her life, I encountered the problem of her colossal mistakes. Caterina did some very controversial things. Some were clever plays and I think, at the end of the day, wisely done. Others, however, were embarrassing and even cruel. I became fascinated with someone who had so publically and terribly fallen from grace through her own actions and how she recovered from it. One of the most interesting things to me about her was that she would never give up, even when the enemy she had to conquer was herself.</p> <p></p> <br> <p><strong>Photos from the Book</strong> <br> <strong>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</strong> <br></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> Romantic depiction of Caterina Sforza being taken prisoner after the assassination of her husband, Girolamo Riario, ruler of Imola and Forli.

It's the trunk of the tree, and all other behaviors are like branches growing outward from there. Many trainers think the first training step is to put a leash or choke chain around your dog's neck, take him outside, and teach him to heel. But if he doesn't even know how to sit, how will you get his attention in the midst of a million smells, sounds, and motions all distracting him, making you the least interesting influence in his environment? You must establish a connection with your dog, and the first step is teaching him how to sit. When your dog feels secure with you as his leader, he'll be happy to stay close and follow your lead as you introduce new challenges. Teaching your dog to sit without force or a leash is easy since it is something that he does naturally. </p><p> I recently worked with a two-month-old white Doberman puppy named Flash. I guess his owner, Eddie, was expecting a burly male trainer with a bag of torture devices and a rough demeanor. What he got instead was a petite woman with a bag of treats and a penchant for "making a party" every time his dog did something right. </p><p> "Does he know how to sit?" I asked, ignoring Eddie's obvious disappointment in meeting me. </p><p> Eddie sniffed. "Of course. There's no need to start there. Flash sits in every corner of the house all day long. I need him to learn to heel! When I take him for a walk, he pulls me down the street. How can I stop him?" </p><p> Since Eddie and his wife had three children, I crouched on the floor at the height of the youngest child and asked the dog to sit. He looked at me like he'd never heard the word before, since he thought that "sit" only happened when someone stood to face him. It took him twenty minutes, but when he finally got it, I went to town "making a party," feeding him a luscious jackpot and using my voice as if it were confetti. </p><p> "Flash didn't really know how to sit, did he?" asked Eddie sheepishly. </p><p> "No, he didn't," I said. "Do you see why I didn't want to take him outside to heel first? He needs the foundation of 'sit.' Then we can teach him anything." </p><p> I'm sure you can appreciate how amusing and satisfying it was to see Eddie, a grown man in a suit and tie, lying on the kitchen floor beside me, "making a party" for Flash! </p><p> I remember when I first picked up Duke from the vet and took him to Covenant House. Although he was excited to perform a variety of exercises, when we asked him to sit, he ignored us. I realized that his previously broken legs made sitting on request uncomfortable, so I showed the teens in the program how to do what I call "passive training." It requires no effort -- only awareness and treats. </p><p> Each time Duke sat on his own accord, we praised him with a treat and enthusiastically sang out the word "sit!" as if he had just climbed Mt. Everest. Kids are wonderfully open about using their voices melodically, and so after a few "singing lessons" with these talented young adults, with no force or pressure, Duke learned to sit when he was asked. What's more, sitting became his favorite thing to do, because he loved the big fuss they made. </p><p> Many years ago I went to observe a class that was held at a local pet store. One of the dogs, a German shepherd, refused to sit. While each owner was practicing with his own dog in the class area, the trainer decided to help the shepherd get over his "stubbornness." But no amount of choking, jerking his neck, or verbally commanding and shaming would convince the dog to sit. The trainer did every abusive thing she could think of, including poking and pushing with all her weight on the dog's rump. He still refused to sit, and after a stressful and violent session, he ended up biting the trainer on her hand. Fearing for the dog's life, I got his owner's number and called a few days later. </p><p> "How is your dog doing?" I asked. </p><p> "He's with the vet," said the owner. </p><p> "Why? Are you going to give him up?" I asked. </p><p> "No," the owner informed me. "He had an abscess on his rear end and he's getting treatment for it." The poor dog was suffering with a painful abscess, but he had no way to tell anyone. When he just couldn't take it anymore, he finally reverted to biting as self-preservation. </p><p> I've seen so many people turn the other way when their dog is giving them a clear message that something is wrong. I once watched a terribly disturbing segment on CNN that profiled a woman who sat by while a so-called dog trainer beat her seven-month-old German shepherd puppy to death because he was too rambunctious to obey. The owner said that the trainer gave her the following heads-up: "Your puppy may cry, try to escape, or pee when I'm training him, but that's all normal." </p><p> Give me a break! There is <i>nothing</i> normal about those behaviors. If you are doing everything right and your dog refuses to do something, don't beat him up. If he refuses to do something and there is no apparent reason why, I recommend taking your dog to the vet for a checkup. If he gets a clean bill of health, then take him home and start the training all over again. But you should never revert to pushing, shoving, or pressing on your dog to get him to sit. When you force your dog into a position, the stress involved will inhibit his ability to learn and figure it out for himself, not to mention the mental and physical abuse you are inflicting upon him. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>THE MAGNET</b> </p><p> The easiest way to teach a dog to sit is a method I call "the magnet." Hold a treat in your hand, covering it with your fingers. Make sure that nothing sticks out, so the dog can't steal it, and move it back over the dog's head, toward his tail. The dog will follow it with his head back as if your hand is a magnet. Because of the way a dog is built, lifting the treat from his nose up slightly toward the top of his head will get him to sit. In this kind and gentle way, I can instantly move 99.9 percent of dogs into the sit position without a word or a touch. </p><p> Holding the treat too high is a common mistake. One pointer's owner kept holding his hand so high above his dog's head that the dog had to jump to get to the treat. I found out pretty quickly that he was afraid that his dog would nip at him. As a result, every time the dog reached for the treat with his mouth, the owner jerked his hand back. The dog must have been thinking, <i>This jumping business is fun! It's so easy to snatch that treat from you.</i> As you can imagine, his jumping skills improved while his sitting skills all but disappeared. I needed to stop the work and focus on helping the owner get rid of his fears of being nipped. Then we had to change the hand signal for sit, since the dog thought that meant to jump on his owner. It took only one day to resolve this issue, and the pointer was well on his way to becoming a well-mannered dog. Remember that if you're doing the magnet and your dog is jumping to get the treat, you're probably holding your hand too high. If he's backing away instead of sitting, practice the sit against a wall, so he has nowhere to go. </p><p> Be encouraging, patient, and sweet throughout the learning process, and remember to keep your fingers securely wrapped around the treat. If even a corner is showing and available to your dog, he will try reaching up and grabbing it from underneath. Never underestimate his intelligence to figure out how to get what he wants. As soon as your dog sits, give him the treat and introduce him to the word "sit" in a happy singsong voice, repeating the word over and over: "Sit, sit, sit." </p><p> Like the example above, first I teach the pattern, and only afterward do I give it a name. Let your voice show your dog that you approve and are impressed with his genius behavior. Soon you'll see your dog thinking, <i>Boy, am I a good people trainer! Each time I sit, I get a goody, so I'll do it as much as I can!</i> Now your dog is asking you to train him! Kids as young as two or three can practice this. It will teach them to be calm around the dog, and it can help kids who are afraid of dogs to overcome their fears. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>THE THREE LEVELS OF SIT</b> </p><p> The lesson is not over once your dog has learned that "sit" means "putting his tush on the ground." As Eddie discovered with his Doberman, Flash, many dogs only respond to "sit" when their owner is standing up. Years ago, at a seminar for dog trainers, the instructor asked the participants to stand up and ask their dog to sit. The trainers scoffed at how ridiculous and elementary that request was. The feeling around the room was "Come on, we're professional dog trainers!" </p><p> Undeterred the instructor then asked everybody to lie down on the floor and tell their dog to sit. Can I tell you how many confused dogs were running around, trying to figure out what their owner was asking of them? The dogs thought that "sit" meant that when the person in front of them stood, they would drop their tushes to the ground. But if the owners didn't give them the usual physical cue, the dogs were confused. Even the most savvy of professional trainers can fall into the trap of thinking that he is teaching the dog one thing when in fact he is teaching him something else. This is why I advise you to generalize each exercise as much as possible. Your dog will learn to recognize the signal that you are giving him rather than just the context in which you usually give it. </p><p> If you wonder why on Earth you should teach your dog to sit while you're lying down, think about different scenarios in which you might be on the floor -- playing with your children, practicing your yoga routine, or hanging out on the lawn with friends. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy what you're doing and know that you still have control as the leader? You'll never have to worry that your dog will climb all over you. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <b>TEACH SIT FROM A STANDING POSITION</b> </p><p> Since we need to train the dog to sit from all levels, let's start with the easiest -- the standing position. I always start with the easiest first, so the dog's success will bolster his confidence f...</p></p><h2>Shatterproof (The 39 Clues: Cahills vs. Vespers, Book 4)</h2><p>The fourth book in the CAHILLS VS.

The bending, stretching, and deep breathing have become a kind of oxygen for the modern soul, as a tour of the neighborhood shows rather quickly. New condo developments feature yoga studios as perks. Cruise ships tout the accomplishments of their yoga instructors, as do tropical resorts. Senior centers and children&#x2019;s museums offer the stretching as a fringe benefit&#x2014;<i>Hey, parents, fitness can be fun.</i> Hollywood stars and professional athletes swear by it. Doctors prescribe it for natural healing. Hospitals run beginner classes, as do many high schools and colleges. Clinical psychologists urge patients to try yoga for depression. Pregnant women do it (very carefully) as a form of prenatal care. The organizers of writing and painting workshops have their pupils do yoga to stir the creative spirit. So do acting schools. Musicians use it to calm down before going on stage.<br> <br>Not to mention all the regular classes. In New York City, where I work, it seems like a yoga studio is doing business every few blocks. You can also take classes in Des Moines and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.<br> <br>Once an esoteric practice of the few, yoga has transformed itself into a global phenomenon as well as a universal icon of serenity, one that resonates deeply with tense urbanites. In 2010, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, began illustrating its parking tickets with a series of calming yoga poses.<br> <br>The popularity of yoga arises not only because of its talent for undoing stress but because its traditions make an engaging counterpoint to modern life. It&#x2019;s unplugged and natural, old and centered&#x2014;a kind of anti-civilization pill that can neutralize the dissipating influence of the Internet and the flood of information we all face. Its ancient serenity offers a new kind of solace.<br> <br>An indication of yoga&#x2019;s social ascendency is how its large centers often get housed in former churches, monasteries, and seminaries, the settings frequently rural and inspirational. Kripalu, on more than three hundred rolling acres of the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, was once a Jesuit seminary. Each year its yoga school graduates hundreds of new teachers. And they in turn produce thousands of new yogis and yoginis, or female yogis.<br> <br>Even the White House is into yoga. Michelle Obama made it part of Let&#x2019;s Move&#x2014;her national program of exercise for children, which seeks to fight obesity. The First Lady talks about yoga on school visits and highlights the discipline at the annual Easter Egg Roll, the largest public event on the White House social calendar. Starting in 2009, the egg roll has repeatedly featured a Yoga Garden with colorful mats and helpful teachers. The sessions start early and go throughout the day.<br> <br>On the White House lawn in 2010, an adult dressed as the Cat in the Hat&#x2014;a character from the Dr. Seuss book&#x2014;did a standing posture on one leg. A tougher demonstration featured five yogis simultaneously upending themselves in Headstands. At the 2011 event, the Easter Bunny did a tricky balancing pose. The children watched, played along, and took home a clear message about what the President and First Lady considered to be a smart way of getting in shape.<br> <br>Yoga is one of the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing health and fitness activities. The Yoga Health Foundation, based in California, puts the current number of practitioners in the United States at twenty million and around the globe at more than two hundred and fifty million. Many more people, it says, are interested in trying yoga. To spread the word, the foundation organizes Yoga Month&#x2014;a celebration every September that blankets the United States with free yoga classes, activities, and health fairs.<br> <br>By any measure, the activity is too widespread and its participants too affluent for advertisers and the news media to ignore. Health and beauty magazines do regular features. <i>The New York Times</i>, where I work, has run hundreds of articles and in 2010 began a regular column, Stretch<i>.</i> It has profiled everything from studios that offer hot yoga in overheated rooms to a gathering of thousands in Central Park that its organizers called the largest yoga class on record. A main attraction of that event was the corporate gifts. Participants got JetBlue yoga mats, SmartWater bottles, and ChicoBags filled with giveaways. The allure was so great that many people got stuck in entrance lines before a downpour chased everybody away.<br> <br>Yoga may be in the air culturally. But it is also quite visibly a big business. Merchants sell mats, clothes, magazines, books, videos, travel junkets, creams, healing potions, shoes, soy snacks, and many accessories deemed vital to practice&#x2014;as well as classes. Purists call it the yoga industrial complex. Increasingly, the big financial stakes have upended the traditional ethos. Bikram Choudhury, the founder of Bikram Yoga, a hot style, copyrighted his sequence of yoga poses and had his lawyers send out hundreds of threatening notices that charged small studios with violations. He is not alone. In the United States, yoga entrepreneurs have sought to enhance their exclusivity by registering thousands of patents, trademarks, and copyrights.<br> <br>Market analysts identify yoga as part of a demographic known as LOHAS&#x2014;for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability. Its upscale, well-educated individuals are drawn to sustainable living and ecological initiatives. They drive hybrid cars, buy natural products, and seek healthy lifestyles. Yoga moms (a demographic successor to soccer moms) are an example. According to marketing studies, they tend to buy clothes for their children from such places as Mama&#x2019;s Earth, its goods made from organic cotton, hemp, and recycled materials.<br> <br>One factor that distinguishes modern yoga from its predecessors is its transformation from a calling into a premium lifestyle. Another is that women make up the vast majority of its practitioners, a fact that dramatically influences the nature of its marketplace. Women buy more books than men, read more, spend more on consumer goods, and pay more attention to their health and appearance.<br> <br><i>Yoga Journal</i>&#x2014;the field&#x2019;s leading magazine, founded in 1975&#x2014;claims two million readers and identifies its audience as 87 percent women. It revels in their quality, citing high incomes, impressive jobs, and good educations. A brochure for prospective advertisers notes that more than 90 percent have gone to college.<br> <br>The colorful pages of the magazine offer a vivid example of how companies target the demographic. Hundreds of ads promote skin-care products, sandals, jewelry, natural soaps, special vitamins and enzymes, alternative cures and therapies, smiling gurus, and ecofriendly cars. Each issue features an index to advertisers. One of my favorites is Hard Tail, a clothing line whose ads feature attractive women in striking poses. &#x201c;Forever,&#x201d; reads the minimalist copy.<br> <br>Another is Lululemon Athletica, a hip brand of yoga clothing known for its form-fitting apparel, most especially its ability to shape and display the buttocks to best advantage. Recently, a market analyst identified Lulu&#x2019;s signature item as the $98 Groove Pant, &#x201c;cut with all kinds of special gussets and flat seams to create a snug gluteal enclosure of almost perfect globularity, like a drop of water.&#x201d;<br> <br>All of which bears on what yoga (as opposed to its accessories) does for the body and mind or, more precisely, on what gurus, spas, books, instructional videos, merchants, television shows, magazines, resorts, and health clubs say that it does.<br> <br>In this regard, it is important to remember that yoga has no governing body. There&#x2019;s no hierarchy of officials or organizations meant to ensure purity and adherence to agreed-upon sets of facts and poses, rules and procedures, outcomes and benefits. It&#x2019;s not like a religion or modern medicine, where rigorous schooling, licensing, and boards seek to produce a high degree of conformity. And forget about government oversight. There&#x2019;s no body such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission or the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that yoga lives up to its promises. Instead, it&#x2019;s a free-for-all&#x2014;and always has been. Over the ages, that freedom has resulted in a din of conflicting claims.<br> <br>&#x201c;The beginner,&#x201d; notes I. K. Taimni, an Indian scholar, &#x201c;is likely to feel repulsed by the confusion and exaggerated statements.&#x201d; Taimni wrote that a half century ago. Today the situation is worse. For one thing, the explosion in publishing&#x2014;print and electronic&#x2014;has amplified the din into a cacophony. Another factor is the profit motive.<br> <br>Billions of dollars are now at stake in public representations of what yoga can do, and the temptations are plentiful to lace declarations with everything from self-deception and happy imprecision to willful misrepresentations and shadings of the truth. Another temptation is to avoid any mention of damage or adverse consequences&#x2014;a silence often rooted in economic rationalizations. Why tell the whole story if full disclosure might drive away customers? Why limit the sales appeal? Why not let the discipline be all things to all people?<br> <br>Anyone who has done yoga for a while can rattle off a list of benefits. It calms and relaxes, eases and renews, energizes and strengthens. It somehow makes us feel better.<br> <br>But beyond such basics lies a frothy hodgepodge of public claims and assurances, sales pitches and New Age promises. The topics include some of life&#x2019;s most central aspirations&#x2014;health, attractiveness, fitness, healing, sleep, safety, longevity, peace, willpower, control of body weight, happiness, love, knowledge, sexual satisfaction, personal growth, fulfillment, and the far boundaries of what it means to be human, not to mention enlightenment.<br> <br>This book cuts through the confusion that surrounds modern yoga and describes what science tells us. It unravels more than a century&#x2019;s worth of research to discern what&#x2019;s real and what&#x2019;s not, what helps and what hurts&#x2014;and nearly as important, why. It casts light on yoga&#x2019;s hidden workings as well as the disconcerting reality of false claims and dangerous omissions. At heart, it illuminates the risks and the rewards.<br> <br>Many, it turns out, are unfamiliar.<br> <br>I came to this book as a knowledgeable amateur. During my freshman year of college, in 1970, I got hooked on yoga because it felt good and seemed to make me healthier in body and mind. My first teacher said it was important to do some&#x2014;even a little&#x2014;every day. That&#x2019;s always been my goal, despite the usual struggle with good intentions. Yoga has become a good friend to whom I turn no matter how crazy my life gets.<br> <br>I began my research in 2006. My plan was simple. I&#x2019;d track down the best science I could find and answer a lot of questions that I had accumulated over the decades, things I had wondered about but never had a chance to explore.<br> <br>My first surprise was how yoga had morphed into a confusing array of styles and brands. I knew enough to understand that the origin of it all was Hatha yoga&#x2014;the variety that centers on postures, breathing, and drills meant to strengthen the body and the mind (as opposed to the yogas of ethics and religious philosophy). Today, Hatha and its offspring are the most widely practiced forms of yoga on the planet, having produced scores of variations that range from local styles in most every country to such ubiquitous global brands as Iyengar and Ashtanga.<br> <br>My enthusiasm for gyms and swimming also gave me a reasonable perspective on how yoga differs from regular exercise. In general (with exceptions we&#x2019;ll study closely), it goes slow rather than fast, emphasizing static postures and fluid motions rather than the rapid, forceful repetitions of, say, spinning or running. Its low-impact nature puts less strain on the body than traditional sports, increasing its appeal for young people as well as aging boomers. In terms of physiology, it takes a minimalist approach to burning calories, contracting muscles, and stressing the body&#x2019;s cardiovascular system. Perhaps most distinctively, it places great emphasis on controlling the breath and fostering an inner awareness of body position. Advanced yoga, in turn, goes further to encourage concentration on subtle energy flows. Overall, compared to sports and other forms of Western exercise, yoga draws the attention inward.<br> <br>I began examining the yogic literature with a sense of wariness. Long ago, while working at the University of Wisconsin on a study of respiratory physiology, I came across a flat contradiction to one of modern yoga&#x2019;s central tenets&#x2014;that fast breathing floods the body and brain with revitalizing oxygen. In contrast, a textbook I was reading at the time said the pace of human respiration &#x201c;can drop to one-half or rise to over one hundred times normal without appreciably influencing the amount of blood oxygenated.&#x201d; I see now that, in 1975, I underlined that passage quite heavily.<br> <br>Unfortunately, my survey lived up to my low expectations. Some books and authors shone brightly. (See Further Reading for a list.) But on the whole, I found the literature dull with dreaminess, assertions with no references, and a surprising number of obvious untruths. I wanted tips for tracking down good science but instead got a muddle. The writing, old and new, turned out to run toward the curiously dogmatic and, at best, to contain only a smattering of science. Much of it was similar to what Richard Feynman, a founder of modern physics, disparaged as cargo-cult science&#x2014;that is, material that appears scientific but lacks factual integrity.<br> <br>By contrast, my plunge into the scientific literature left me heartened. Federal officials at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, run a wonderful electronic library of global medical reports known as PubMed, short for Public Medicine. It showed that scientists had written nearly one thousand papers related to yoga&#x2014;the number rising in the early 1970s and soaring in recent years, with reports added every few days. The studies ranged from the flaky and superficial to the probing and rigorous. The authors included researchers at Princeton and Duke, Harvard and Columbia. Moreover, the field had gone global. Scientists in Sweden and Hong Kong were publishing serious papers.<br> <br>But the closer I looked, the more I judged this body of information to be rather limited. Some general topics had been covered fairly well&#x2014;for instance, how yoga can relax and heal. But many others were ignored, and much of the published science turned out to be superficial. For instance, studies for the approval of a new drug can require the participation of hundreds or even thousands of human subjects, the large numbers increasing the reliability of the findings. In contrast, many yoga investigations had fewer than a dozen participants. Some featured just one individual.<br> <br>The superficiality turned out to have fairly obvious roots. Research on yoga was often a hobby or a sideline. It had no big corporate sponsors (there being no hope of discoveries that could lead to expensive pills or medical devices) and relatively little financial support from governments. Federal centers tend to specialize in advanced kinds of esoteric research as well as pressing issues of public health, with their investigations typically carried out at institutes and universities. In short, modern science seemed to care little.<br> <br>The exception turned out to be areas where yoga intersected other disciplines or made bold claims strongly at odds with the conventional wisdom. Such crossroads proved to be scientifically rich. For instance, scientists interested in sports medicine and exercise physiology had lavished attention on yoga&#x2019;s fitness cla...</p><h2>Hunter (A Hunter Novel, 1)</h2><p>They came after the Diseray.

Since a catastrophic event called the Disarray, monsters of all kinds have crossed into the real world from the Otherworld and it's the Hunters' jobs to destroy them. Joy and her supernatural Hounds are summoned to the capital city, Apex, where she learns that Hunters there are regarded as celebrities, with their own television channels and rankings. As Joy adjusts to her flashy new life, gets to know the other Hunters, and starts Hunting, she begins to realize that Apex is not as safe as it seems and that there are secrets the government does not want exposed. This satisfying sci-fi YA novel is set in a fully thought-out future with cultural references woven throughout. Joy's Hounds are Alebrijes, and the monsters she hunts come from a variety of sources: Drakkens, Folk (evil fairies), Vamps, Tommyknockers, Gogs, and Magogs. The protagonist is a principled, smart, strong girl and is easy to root for. The language can be clunky at times, but the incredible world-building more than makes up for it.

A true innovator who has spent a lifetime exploring a range of musical genres, and enriching each of them, Hancock has had an enormous influence on acoustic and electric jazz, R&amp;B, funk, and hip-hop. <br><br>From his beginnings as a child prodigy to his early classic Blue Note recordings; from his work in Miles Davis&#x2019;s second great quintet to his innovations as the leader of his own groundbreaking sextet; from era-defining classic albums like <i>Head Hunters</i> and <i>River: The Joni Letters</i> to his collaborations with artists like Wayne Shorter and Stevie Wonder, Hancock reveals the methods behind his ever-evolving musical genius. He discusses his influences, his happy marriage, and how his practice of Buddhism has inspired him both creatively and personally. Honest, enlightening, and as electrifyingly vital as its author, this is an invaluable contribution to jazz literature and an intimate, insightful portrait of a creative life.</p><p><b>Herbie Hancock</b> has won fourteen Grammy Awards, as well as an Academy Award for the score of&nbsp;<i>Round Midnight</i>. Hancock&#x2019;s <i>Head Hunters</i> is the second-bestselling jazz album of all time. In 2011 he was named as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, in 2013 he was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors, and in 2014 he was the first jazz musician to deliver the prestigious Norton Lectures at Harvard University.<p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>I&#x2019;m onstage at a concert hall in Stockholm, Sweden, in the mid-1960s playing piano with the Miles Davis Quintet. We&#x2019;re on tour, and this show is really heating up. The band is tight&#x2014;we&#x2019;re all in sync, all on the same wavelength. The music is flowing, we&#x2019;re connecting with the audience, and everything feels magical, like we&#x2019;re weaving a spell.</p><p>Tony Williams, the drumming prodigy who joined Miles as a teenager, is on fire. Ron Carter&#x2019;s fingers are flying up and down the neck of his bass, and Wayne Shorter&#x2019;s saxophone is just screaming. The five of us have become one entity, shifting and flowing with the music. We&#x2019;re playing one of Miles&#x2019;s classics, &#x201c;So What,&#x201d; and as we hurtle toward Miles&#x2019;s solo, it&#x2019;s the peak of the evening; the whole audience is on the edge of their seats.</p><p>Miles starts playing, building up to his solo, and just as he&#x2019;s about to really let loose, he takes a breath. And right then I play a chord that is just <i>so </i>wrong. I don&#x2019;t even know where it came from&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the wrong chord, in the wrong place, and now it&#x2019;s hanging out there like a piece of rotten fruit. I think, <i>Oh, shit</i>. It&#x2019;s as if we&#x2019;ve all been building this gorgeous house of sound, and I just accidentally put a match to it.</p><p>Miles pauses for a fraction of a second, and then he plays some notes that somehow, miraculously, make my chord sound right. In that moment I believe my mouth actually fell open. What kind of alchemy was this? And then Miles just took off from there, unleashing a solo that took the song in a new direction. The crowd went absolutely crazy.</p><p>I was in my early twenties and had already been with Miles for a couple of years by this time. But he always was capable of surprising me, and that night, when he somehow turned my chord from a wrong to a right, he definitely did. In the dressing room after the show I asked Miles about it. I felt a little sheepish, but Miles just winked at me, a hint of a smile on his chiseled face. He didn&#x2019;t say anything. He didn&#x2019;t have to. Miles wasn&#x2019;t one to talk a whole lot about things when he could show us something instead.</p><p>It took me years to fully understand what happened in that moment onstage. As soon as I played that chord I judged it. In my mind it was the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; chord. But Miles never judged it&#x2014;he just heard it as a sound that had happened, and he instantly took it on as a challenge, a question of <i>How can I integrate that chord into everything else we&#x2019;re doing? </i>And because he didn&#x2019;t judge it, he was able to run with it, to turn it into something amazing. Miles trusted the band, and he trusted himself, and he always encouraged us to do the same. This was just one of many lessons I learned from Miles.</p><p>We all have a natural human tendency to take the safe route&#x2014;to do the thing we know will work&#x2014;rather than taking a chance. But that&#x2019;s the antithesis of jazz, which is all about being in the present. Jazz is about being in the moment, at every moment. It&#x2019;s about trusting yourself to respond on the fly. If you can allow yourself to do that, you never stop exploring, you never stop learning, in music or in life.</p><p>I was lucky enough to learn this not only from playing with Miles but over the decades of playing that have followed. And I&#x2019;m still learning it, every single day. It&#x2019;s a gift that I never could have imagined back when I first started plunking around on my friend Levester Corley&#x2019;s piano at the age of six.</p><p>Levester Corley lived in the same building as my family, on the corner of Forty-Fifth Street and King Drive on the South Side of Chicago. We lived in a poor neighborhood, but it wasn&#x2019;t the worst one in 1940s Chicago. It was probably a step up from the worst, meaning that we didn&#x2019;t live in the projects but they were close by.</p><p>I never thought of our neighborhood as being a &#x201c;bad&#x201d; one, though parts of it were rough. There were gangs, and there was a run-down house down the block we called the Big House&#x2014;slang for prison. Most days there were young men hanging out in front of the Big House, and when you saw that, you knew to walk on the other side of the street. But for the most part I never felt unsafe or threatened. I just assumed that my neighborhood was pretty much like everyone else&#x2019;s.</p><p>I was born in 1940, and when I was really little, I thought we were rich, because we always had everything we wanted. We had clothes to wear and food to eat, and a Christmas tree and toys every year, so what did I know? I had never met anyone from outside our neighborhood, and compared to some of the other families on our block, we seemed to be doing great. In the basement of our own building, there was one family living with about ten people crammed into a single room. In comparison, we had a two-bedroom for five people&#x2014;my parents, my brother, Wayman, my sister, Jean, and me&#x2014;which felt like a luxury.</p><p>Levester lived on another floor in our building, and when he turned six, his parents bought him a piano. I&#x2019;d always liked just hanging around with Levester, but once he got that piano, all I wanted to do was go to his apartment and play it. I loved the feel of the keys under my fingers, even though I didn&#x2019;t really know what I was doing. We&#x2019;d plunk around on it, and I&#x2019;d try to play songs, and when I went back to our apartment, I&#x2019;d tell my mom about it. After a while she said to my father, &#x201c;We need to get this boy a piano.&#x201d; And so when I was seven, they gave me a used piano they&#x2019;d bought for about $5 in a church basement.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not surprising that my mother, Winnie Griffin Hancock, was eager for me to have a piano. She was always anxious to instill an appreciation of culture in her children, even naming me&#x2014;Herbert Jeffrey Hancock&#x2014;after an African American singer and actor, Herb Jeffries. To my mother, culture meant music, so she made sure we grew up listening to Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Mozart, and Handel. She also loved the music that came out of the black community&#x2014;jazz and blues&#x2014;and felt we should be connected to it as part of our heritage. But &#x201c;good music&#x201d; to her was classical music, so when I got my piano, she sent my brother and me to take classical lessons.</p><p>My mother&#x2019;s feelings on class and culture were rooted in her unusual childhood in the South. Her mother&#x2014;my grandmother Winnie Daniels&#x2014;grew up poor in Americus, Georgia, in a family of sharecroppers working the property of a wealthy family called the Griffins. But when my grandmother came of age, she married one of the Griffin sons, and just like that, she went from being a sharecropper to being a landowner&#x2019;s wife. So my mom and her brother, Peter, were born into a wealthier environment than most southern black kids at the time.</p><p>Growing up, I was always told that my grandfather Griffin was black, but in the few pictures I saw, he didn&#x2019;t look it. Years later, my mother told me he was actually white, so to this day I couldn&#x2019;t tell you which is the truth. What I do know is that sometime during the 1920s, my grandfather lost his entire fortune. He died soon after, and my grandmother picked up and moved the family to Chicago to start over.</p><p>It was a rough transition. After enjoying a life of relative privilege in Georgia, my grandmother and my mother were forced to take work as maids in Chicago. My mom cleaned houses for white families throughout high school, and understandably she hated it. She spent two years in college, which enabled her to get a job as a secretary, and eventually she became a guidance counselor for the Illinois State Department of Employment. She worked hard, carried herself with dignity, and raised all three of her children to believe we could achieve great things.</p><p>That was my mother&#x2019;s good side. But there was another side, too. She was bipolar, though we didn&#x2019;t know what that was&#x2014;in those days people just used words like &#x201c;headstrong&#x201d; and &#x201c;high-strung.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d get into fights with family members, big screaming arguments where she&#x2019;d shout and cry and argue until her neck veins popped out. In our house, it was my mother&#x2019;s way or the highway, but my dad tried to dismiss her rages as &#x201c;just Winnie being Winnie.&#x201d; He loved her, and he tended to put her on a pedestal, because she carried herself in that dignified manner. But he also knew better than to get in her way. Whenever we asked him for something, he was quick to say, &#x201c;Go ask your mother.&#x201d;</p><p>My father was a sweet, easygoing man, the guy cracking jokes in any group. He was raised by my grandmother and grandfather Hancock, but what very few people know is that at birth he wasn&#x2019;t actually a Hancock at all. He was born during my grandmother&#x2019;s first marriage, to a man with the last name of Pace. I don&#x2019;t know anything about my grandfather Pace, except that my grandmother always said he was a bad guy. She left him and married Louis Hancock, who adopted my father and gave him his&#x2014;and now my&#x2014;name.</p><p>Growing up, my dad wanted to be a doctor. But for a poor black family from Georgia in the 1930s, that was completely out of the question. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t even get to finish high school, dropping out after his sophomore year following a family discussion about finances. By then the family had moved to Chicago, and my dad knew that if he worked hard enough, his two younger brothers could go to college, so he sacrificed his own education to make that happen. From the time he was a teenager, my dad worked in the grocery business, and although he never went back to school, he eventually managed to buy his own store.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was too giving to be a good businessman. He was always extending people credit, and then he had a hard time pressing them for money. Or he&#x2019;d buy cuts of meat from the stockyards for other mom-and-pop stores, acting as the middleman, and then it was the same story: He let them pay on credit, and then he could never ask them for the money. Dad&#x2019;s generosity threatened to bankrupt his business, and he ultimately sold his store. He worked a lot of different jobs while I was growing up, unskilled positions like cabdriver and bus driver, since he had just two years of high school. Eventually he became a government meat inspector at the Chicago stockyards.</p><p>My uncles thought of my dad as a hero for having sacrificed his own education for them. But my mother, sharp-tongued and opinionated, would sometimes tease him cruelly about his lack of education, calling him dumb or worse. She didn&#x2019;t do it often, and it was most likely because of her illness, but she knew how to use words to wound him.</p><p>I knew that my parents loved each other, and I watched as my dad tried to be patient with my mom, even when she got into a &#x201c;headstrong&#x201d; state. But every once in a while, her rages got physical. One afternoon I happened to see my dad in his undershirt, and I could see scratch marks all down his back. He never talked about it, and in fact I never heard him say a single bad word about my mother. No matter how mercurial she might be, he was always steady, which is probably a big reason why I remember my childhood as a stable, happy time.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s another reason for that, too: From the time I was very young, I&#x2019;ve always tended to see the good in situations rather than the bad. Not because I was trying to be a Goody Two-Shoes or make a point to anyone else&#x2014;I just somehow never really noticed or paid attention to the bad things. I&#x2019;m an optimist at heart, always have been.</p><p>Years after my sister, Jean, grew up and moved away from Chicago, she wrote a short autobiography for a class. This was how she described the neighborhood where we grew up:</p><p>Girls became pregnant upon puberty, boys worshipped and eventually copied the habits of heroin dealers, and kitchen gossip chronicled the purchase of stolen goods, weekend knife fights, and the &#x201c;turning out&#x201d; of a young lady with a nice body. Our area of commerce was heavily weighted with liquor stores, smelly groceries, well-fortressed currency exchanges, and tawdry five-and-dimes.</p><p>Was this all true? I suppose it was. But whenever I think of our neighborhood, I think of shooting marbles with my brother, or getting Goldenrod ice cream down at my dad&#x2019;s store, or standing on a corner with friends and singing R&amp;B songs by groups like the Five Thrills and the Ravens. Ever since I can remember, I&#x2019;ve tended to focus on the good rather than the bad. It&#x2019;s a trait I feel lucky to have.</p><p>Some older brothers don&#x2019;t want anything to do with their younger siblings, but my brother, Wayman, wasn&#x2019;t like that. Even though he was three years older, he took me everywhere with him.</p><p>He loved playing games and sports, so he&#x2019;d bring me along to shoot marbles or play softball even though I was terrible at it. I was small for my age and had no interest in sports, but he still seemed to like having me there.</p><p>He remembers one softball game in which his team was up by about twenty runs and they encouraged me to take a turn pitching. I was probably about six years old, and they put me right up close to the plate, but I just couldn&#x2019;t pitch strikes. I walked the first five batters, and when I finally got one over the plate, the whole team erupted into cheers.</p><p>My relationship with my sister wasn&#x2019;t as easy. Jean was the only girl, and she was the youngest, so she sometimes felt left out. She&#x2019;d get so frustrated because she just wanted to be one of the boys. One time we even caught her in the bathroom trying to pee standing up, which we never let her forget.</p><p>Jean was three years younger than me, but she could be smart and sharp-tongued like my mother. Because she was so smart, she could talk her way through anything, and once she had an opinion, she held tight to it like a bulldog. She could have been a debate champion, because she knew exactly how to manipulate an argument. She and I got along really well, but when we did argue, she&#x2019;d somehow get me backed into a corner. Once I got so frustrated I just wanted to hit her. But for the most part, during our early childhood anyway, we got along.</p><p>Even though Jean was younger than me, she could be intimidating. She could be fierce, and both she and my mother knew how to hurt someone verbally. Maybe because they were so similar in that way, my mom and sister used to have confrontations. My mother&#x2019;s bipolar illness escalated during my sister&#x2019;s childhood, so as Jean got older, she bore the brunt of it in ways that my brother and I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>In many ways, that was the story of my sister&#x2019;s life&#x2014;that through no fault of her own, she often got the short end of the stick. She was absolutely brilliant, skipping grades in school, teaching herself to play the guitar, playing sports. She could do just about anything better than most people. But as a young black woman growing up in the &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s, there were few expectations, and even fewer opportunities, for her. She had to scratch and claw for everything she got, which was something I never really thought about until years later, after her too-short life had ended.</p><p>The other thing I didn&#x2019;t realize until much later was how badly my sister wanted my approval. Jean was a deeply passionate human being, much more passionate than I am. She was emotional, whereas I&#x2019;ve always been a more rational, reasoning kind of person. She would sometimes try to provoke responses out of me, but I never saw that for what it was: a need on her part, rather than just a provocation. As with so many things tha...</p></p><h2>Save the Date: A Novel</h2><p><p>Can this wedding be saved?</p><p>Up-and-coming floral designer Cara Kryzik is about to score the wedding of a lifetime&#x2015;one that will solidify her career as the go-to-girl for Savannah society nuptials.

Cara Kryzik was no psychic, but the minute her bare feet hit the floor that morning, she sensed it.</p> <p>She sniffed the air apprehensively and was met with the sweet perfume from the tiny nosegay of gardenias&#x2014;her favorites&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d placed in a sterling bud vase on her dresser the night before.</p> <p>Had she overslept? No. The big bells of St. John the Baptist cathedral were ringing the eight-o&#x2019;clock hour as she descended the stairs from her apartment to her shop one floor below.</p> <p>Cara shuffled down the narrow hallway to the front of the darkened flower shop. She flicked on the wall switch, and the multitude of thrift-shop chandeliers she&#x2019;d hung at varying heights from the tall-ceilinged room twinkled to light, their images reflecting from all the mirrors staged around the space. It was a small room, but she thought the chandeliers and mirrors expanded the space visually.</p> <p><i>See?</i> She scoffed at her own foolish sense of foreboding. All was well.</p> <p>She pulled up the shades over the front windows and smiled. It was a bright, sunny Friday morning, and within seconds, her puppy, Poppy, had her nose pressed against the glass-paneled front door, watching a pair of squirrels scamper past on the sidewalk outside on Jones Street.</p> <p>The message-waiting light was blinking on the shop&#x2019;s answering machine. She gave the machine a fond pat. Business had been slow. But it was May. Mother&#x2019;s Day was next Sunday, it was prom season, and wedding season, too. Things were already picking up.</p> <p>And then? She felt a single bead of perspiration trickle down her back. She frowned. Why was it so hot in the shop? Even for Savannah the room seemed stuffy and overheated. Cara went to the thermostat on the wall and squinted, trying to see the reading.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d turned the thermostat up before bed last night, just to 81, hoping to save a little on her always spiraling electricity bill. The air-conditioning unit was temperamental at best, and her landlord was never prompt when it came to making repairs. She had a string of appointments in the shop today, and it wouldn&#x2019;t do to have brides and their mamas stewing in their own juices.</p> <p>She fiddled with the control for a moment, holding her breath, waiting to hear the compressor click to life. When it did, she exhaled. <i>See? All is well.</i></p> <p>Before she could sit down to check her emails, the shop phone rang.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d known who the caller would be. &#x201c;Good morning, Lillian,&#x201d; Cara chirped. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s our bride today? Is she getting jittery?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still asleep, thank God,&#x201d; Lillian Fanning said. Never one to waste time on pleasantries, Lillian got right down to business. &#x201c;Listen, Cara, I&#x2019;ve been thinking. I know we said white candles for the altar, but with an early-evening wedding, I really believe ivory or ecru would be much more effective.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara crossed her eyes in exasperation. She&#x2019;d already special-ordered two dozen hand-dipped organic soy <i>white</i> candles for Torie Fanning&#x2019;s wedding tomorrow. But it was useless to tell the mother of the bride that it was impossible to get the candles in a different color at this late date.</p> <p>She heard the bell on the front door jingle and looked up to see her assistant, Bert, let himself in, a large coffee in one hand and his bicycle helmet in the other.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lillian Fanning?&#x201d; He mouthed the words, and Cara nodded. For the past two weeks, Lillian had called Bloom at least twice a day, every day.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do,&#x201d; Cara said, being deliberately vague.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ecru or ivory, <i>not</i> white,&#x201d; Lillian repeated.</p> <p>Cara sighed. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the flowers? Did everything get delivered? And you&#x2019;ve got Torie&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s epergne polished for the bride&#x2019;s table?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Everything is absolutely under control,&#x201d; Cara assured Lillian. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got all the bridesmaids&#x2019; bouquets finished, and I&#x2019;ll start on Torie&#x2019;s this afternoon, so it will be absolutely the freshest possible. And Lillian? I have to say the two of you have made the most exquisite flower choices I&#x2019;ve ever seen in this town.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I should hope so, for what this wedding is costing us,&#x201d; Lillian Fanning said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at the church tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara hung up and stuck out her tongue at the phone.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is it hot in here, or is it just me?&#x201d; Bert asked, standing in front of the thermostat and fanning himself with an envelope he grabbed off a stack of bills on her desk.</p> <p>&#x201c;I turned it up last night before I went to bed, but I think it&#x2019;s starting to cool down now,&#x201d; Cara said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m roasting,&#x201d; Bert declared. He looked at her closely. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not having chills again, are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! I&#x2019;m fine. I took the last of those darned antibiotics on Tuesday. I can&#x2019;t afford to get sick ever again.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara took Bert&#x2019;s hand and placed it on her own forehead. &#x201c;See? Cool as a cucumber. No fever, no temp, no problem.&#x201d;</p> <p>But Bert wasn&#x2019;t paying attention. He was staring at the glass door of their flower cooler. Even through the door, beaded as it was with condensation, it was a grim sight.</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara flung the door of the cooler open. &#x201c;Oh, God.&#x201d;</p> <p>She couldn&#x2019;t believe her eyes. All the flowers in all the buckets in the cooler were limp, dead, dying. Torie Fanning&#x2019;s bridesmaids&#x2019; bouquets, so carefully wrapped in their silk-satin binding, were toast. She glanced at the thermometer hanging from the top shelf and felt like weeping. It had been at 35 degrees last night, before she&#x2019;d gone upstairs. But now it was at 86.</p> <p>She let the door close and pressed her face against the glass. The reassuring hum of the compressor motor was silent.</p> <p>&#x201c;The cooler is dead,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And so are the flowers. The motor must have conked out sometime overnight.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert reached for the Rolodex on the desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the repairman. Didn&#x2019;t he just fix this thing like six weeks ago?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara nodded glumly. &#x201c;He did. To the tune of three hundred dollars. But he warned me then, he didn&#x2019;t know how long it would keep running. When I opened the shop I bought it off a guy whose pizza place had gone out of business. Turns out this thing is so old, you can&#x2019;t find new parts for it. My guy had to jerry-rig it with secondhand parts he had lying around his shop.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What are we gonna do?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara closed her eyes, hoping for inspiration. &#x201c;I have no idea. All I know is, Lillian Fanning will shit a brick if she finds out about this. You heard me, I just promised her we had everything under control. The most demanding bride I&#x2019;ve ever worked with&#x2014;and this had to happen today.&#x201d;</p> <p>She opened the cooler door again and grabbed the nearest bucket. Three dozen long-stemmed white iceberg roses were crammed into it, and their heads drooped like so many sleepy toddlers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dead.&#x201d; She dropped a handful of roses into the trash and reached for the next bucket, and the next, repeating the diagnosis&#x2014;and throwing them away.</p> <p>When she was done, the big plastic trash bin was full and all that was left on the counter was one bucketful of leatherleaf ferns&#x2014;&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t kill these things, even if you tried,&#x201d; Cara noted&#x2014;and a raggedy assortment of single blossoms that had somehow managed to survive.</p> <p>Bert grabbed one of the pale blue mophead hydrangea blossoms and with his secateurs snipped off the end of the stem. He turned on the faucet in the worktable sink, let the water heat up, then filled an empty bucket with hot water. He plunged the first hydrangea in, and reached for another.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can save these,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll reprocess all of them, strip the leaves, trim the stems. Put some Floralife in the water. They&#x2019;re not all a total loss. I bet they&#x2019;ll perk right back up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara kicked at the trash can with the toe of her sandal, wincing in pain as soon as she&#x2019;d done it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s twelve thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of flowers, gone. Even if we save some of them, there&#x2019;s no way we can even put together a boutonniere out of this mess, let alone enough flowers for Torie, eight bridesmaids, and all the flowers for the church and the reception. And it&#x2019;s too late to get more flowers shipped from California in time for tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert looked around the room, as though a new shipment of flowers might magically appear from thin air.</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the wholesale house? Can&#x2019;t you call them? Or we could run over there and see what they&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Breitmueller&#x2019;s? On a Friday morning in May? With all the weddings and proms going on around town? They&#x2019;ll be picked clean by now. Anyway, they don&#x2019;t carry the kinds of flowers we promised Torie. Lilies of the valley? Ranunculus? Casablanca lilies? Peonies?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about Lamar?&#x201d; Bert asked. &#x201c;I know we usually see him on Thursdays, but maybe, if you called and told him what happened&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara blinked back tears. &#x201c;Lamar&#x2019;s clear up in Atlanta, Bert. He&#x2019;s not gonna come all the way down here just to save my bacon.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert pointed at the phone. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Cara. That old man loves you. He might make a special trip, if you explained what was at stake.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara shrugged and reached for her Rolodex. But before she could flip to Lamar&#x2019;s card, the shop phone rang.</p> <p>She picked up the phone and looked at the caller ID, and her hand froze. The area code was one she knew by heart: 614 for Columbus, Ohio. And, of course, the caller was one she knew all too well, too.</p> <p>She should let the call roll over to voicemail. Ignore it. He&#x2019;d only call back, and keep calling until she picked up. Her day couldn&#x2019;t get much worse now. So why put off the inevitable?</p> <p>Cara swallowed hard and tapped the receive button.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hi, Dad.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>&#x201c;Cara? Are you all right?&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s voice boomed so loudly she had to hold the phone several inches from her ear. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Kryzik&#x2019;s idea of a whisper was more like a shout to most people.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fine, Dad. How are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara felt a knot forming in the pit of her stomach. She knew exactly why the Colonel was calling; had, in fact, been expecting this call for weeks now.</p> <p>&#x201c;Look, Dad, I know I&#x2019;m kinda late with my payment&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a phone call, much less a check from you, in three months now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on down there?&#x201d;</p> <p>She swallowed hard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just coming into my busiest season. Remember, I told you that? I&#x2019;ve got a spring and summer full of weddings booked. But I&#x2019;ve had all kinds of expenses. Buying the van, getting my website designed, finishing out the shop and buying equipment&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Our agreement was that you&#x2019;d start making payments on the loan in February. You should have had plenty of money from Valentine&#x2019;s Day business, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>She felt a stabbing pain between her eyes. &#x201c;We actually had a pretty good Valentine&#x2019;s Day. But all the profits went back into the shop. My computer died, and I had to buy a new one&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not my problem,&#x201d; her father shot back. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d prepared a detailed business plan, as I&#x2019;d suggested, you could have anticipated that a five-year-old computer would need to be replaced. It&#x2019;s called a contingency plan. These things are a cost of doing business, Cara.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know, but&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got business coming into the shop, I&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d be in a position to start repaying at least the interest on your loan,&#x201d; he went on.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad, if you&#x2019;d just let me explain,&#x201d; Cara started.</p> <p>But the Colonel wasn&#x2019;t interested in explanations. Not from her.</p> <p>&#x201c;I should have known something like this would happen. It&#x2019;s never a good idea to loan money to family, especially since you didn&#x2019;t even have a sound business plan for this shop of yours.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Cara said sharply. &#x201c;I drew up a business plan. I did cost projections, market studies, I researched rent and utilities, I did everything I could. But how could I anticipate something like having to replace a computer? Or a deadbeat innkeeper who refuses to pay me for three months&#x2019; worth of arrangements? Just this morning, I came downstairs, and my flower cooler had died. Along with twelve thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of inventory I need for a wedding tomorrow. Some things are just out of my control, Dad. You of all people know that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Water under the bridge,&#x201d; he said, interrupting. &#x201c;The fact is, if you can&#x2019;t even begin repaying the interest on a loan, after six months, your business has no hope of success. Even you can see that, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! I can&#x2019;t see it. My business is building every week. We&#x2019;ve got new clients, a few new commercial accounts. I just need a little more time to get things up and running. This wedding tomorrow, Dad? It&#x2019;s a ten-thousand-dollar deal.&#x201d; Cara hated the pleading note she heard creeping into her voice.</p> <p>&#x201c;For which you just admitted you don&#x2019;t have any flowers,&#x201d; the Colonel shot back. &#x201c;Look, Cara. This just proves my point. You&#x2019;re a smart girl, and a hard worker, I&#x2019;ll give you that. But somebody like you has no business running a business. Take that innkeeper. You think I would have given three months of credit to a new account? Not on your life!&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara felt her left eye twitching, and her headache was taking on a new life of its own. She opened the drawer of her desk, found the bottle of aspirin, popped three into her mouth, and choked them down with a swallow of now-cold coffee.</p> <p>She had to end this call before her head exploded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad? I&#x2019;m sorry, but I really need to go now. We&#x2019;ve got to replace those flowers I lost, and I&#x2019;ve got another bride coming in for an appointment. I&#x2019;ll send you a check by the end of next week. Swear to God. And after that, I&#x2019;ll catch up. Monthly payments, just like we agreed. Okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. Not okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know this is painful for you, Cara, but admit it, this florist thing of yours hasn&#x2019;t worked out. Just like your marriage. And frankly, I&#x2019;m out of patience with pretending everything is okay. I&#x2019;m not some ATM machine, you know. Two years from now, I&#x2019;m retiring from the community college. I have to start thinking about my own welfare. Twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money at my age. I&#x2019;m sorry, but I&#x2019;m pulling the plug on this little enterprise of yours.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara&#x2019;s eyes widened, and her jaw dropped. &#x201c;Pull the plug? What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just what it sounds like. It&#x2019;s over, Cara. No more stalling, no more excuses. I&#x2019;m calling your loan. It&#x2019;s still the first week of May. Close up the shop. Call your landlord, let her know you&#x2019;re breaking your lease. Maybe if you give her plenty of advance notice, she&#x2019;ll prorate your rent.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Break the lease?&#x201d; Cara&#x2019;s mouth went dry. Her hands clutched the phone so hard her fingertips turned white. &#x201c;Close the shop?&#x201d;</p> <p>From across the room, Bert, who&#x2019;d given up any pretense of not listening in, looked as shocked as she felt.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason for you to stay down there in Savannah any longer,&#x201d; her father continued, as though everything were settled, just like that, because he said so. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no ties, there, really. Leo&#x2019;s not taking you back, and anyway&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Leo?&#x201d; Cara screeched. &#x201c;Dad, I left Leo, not the other way around.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A technicality,&#x201d; the Colonel said calmly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not split hairs. I think it would be better if you got a little place of your own. I could probably talk to somebody here at the school about a job, but if you think you still want to fool around with flowers, you can probably find something around town.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; Cara shouted into the phone. &#x201c;Stop. Just stop!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to scream, young lady,&#x201d; the Colonel said sternly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not deaf.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>You might as well be,</i> Cara thought. <i>You never hear a word I say. You never have. I&#x2019;m thirty-six years old, as you dearly love to point out, and you&#x2019;ve never really listened to me. Not in my whole life.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t discu...</p></p><h2>10 Simple Solutions to Adult ADD: How to Overcome Chronic Distraction and Accomplish Your Goals</h2><p><p>Managing attention-deficit disorder (ADD) as an adult is a constant challenge.

D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.The penultimate chapter of this young adult fantasy series spans 10 worlds and multiple eras as Connecticut teenager Bobby Pendragon defends the universe from a demonic shape-shifter bent on reshaping reality in his own image. MacHale&#39;s storytelling is complex and multilayered. It&#39;s also, at times, melodramatic, which makes it not the best match for Dufris, whose gifted comic style and timing are not allowed to shine. Dufris brings a youthful exuberance to the text, excelling when reading the &#34;journal entries&#34; from Pendragon&#39;s point of view. But at the end of the day, his talents are underutilized. Nevertheless, followers of this series will enjoy Dufris&#39;s reading of these history-altering story lines, which lead to the final battle in Book 10.

Unfortunately, many of these assessments are poorly thought through. A president is either praised for the moral clarity of his statements or judged solely on the results of their actions. <br><br>In <em>Do Morals Matter?</em>, Joseph S. Nye, Jr., one of the world's leading scholars of international relations, provides a concise yet penetrating analysis of the role of ethics in US foreign policy during the American era after 1945. Nye works through each presidency from FDR to Trump and scores their foreign policy on three ethical dimensions of their intentions, the means they used, and the consequences of their decisions. Alongside this, he also evaluates their leadership qualities, elaborating on which approaches work and which ones do not. Regardless of a president's policy preference, Nye shows that each one was not fully constrained by the structure of the system and actually had choices. He further notes the important ethical consequences of non-actions, such as Truman's willingness to accept stalemate in Korea rather than use nuclear weapons.<br><br>Since we so often apply moral reasoning to foreign policy, Nye suggests how to do it better. Most importantly, presidents need to factor in both the political context and the availability of resources when deciding how to implement an ethical policy-especially in a future international system that presents not only great power competition from China and Russia, but a host of transnational threats: the illegal drug trade, infectious diseases, terrorism, cybercrime, and climate change.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joseph S. Nye, Jr.</strong> is University Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus and former Dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He received his bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Princeton University, won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, and earned a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard. He has served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Chair of the National Intelligence Council, and a Deputy Under Secretary of State. His most recent books include <em>The Powers to Lead</em>,<em> The Future of Power</em>, <em>Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era</em>, and <em>The Power Game: a Washington Novel.</em> He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the British Academy, and the American Academy of Diplomacy. In a recent survey of international relations scholars, he was ranked as the most influential scholar on American foreign policy, and in 2011, <em>Foreign Policy</em> named him one of the top 100 Global Thinkers.<br><br>"In times like these, it is important to appreciate the role that moral reasoning should play in foreign policy. This is especially true in a democracy, where sustaining global involvement requires support from citizens. Joe Nye is one of our foremost and engaging analysts of American diplomacy, and in this book he provides a clear-eyed guide for reengaging our moral compass." -- Walter Isaacson, Distinguished Fellow and Former CEO, Aspen Institute, and Professor of History, Tulane University<p></p><br>"From the doyen of US foreign policy thinkers, a powerful warning against domestic populist politics, which not only narrow our moral vision but defeat US purposes around the world." -- O.A. Westad, Yale University<p></p><br>"With characteristic insight and precision, Joseph Nye raises tough questions of how much ethics should shape a nation's foreign policy, provides a sweeping review of how past presidents have embraced or rejected ethical imperatives, and constructs a helpful scorecard for judging future presidents. This book takes on even greater significance as a growing number of nations-led by the U.S.-nakedly put self interest first." -- David Gergen, CNN Senior Political Analyst, and Founding Director, Harvard Kennedy School Center for Public Leadership<p></p><br>"In <em>Do Morals Matter?</em> Joseph S. Nye argues persuasively that in foreign policy, good intentions must be accompanied by the use of appropriate means that generate beneficial consequences. His astute analysis of American presidents since World War II demonstrates that 'contextual intelligence' is crucial for moral principles to yield good results." -- Robert O. Keohane, Princeton University<p></p><br>"A lucid, thoughtful and original examination of the role morality plays as American presidents shape their foreign policy. As Professor Nye shows convincingly in this highly readable book, leaders and citizens alike make assumptions, decisions and judgments which reflect their own views about what is good and bad. Yet again he has contributed much to our better understanding of international relations." -- Margaret MacMillan, Emeritus Professor of International History, University of Oxford<p></p><br></p><h2>Basic Real Estate Appraisal, 9th Edition</h2><p>Written by instructors for instructors, Basic Real Estate Appraisal covers the fundamentals of the appraisal business, making concepts accessible for aspiring real estate appraisers.

They used Latin-learning materials containing authentic, enjoyable vignettes about daily life in the ancient world - shopping, banking, going to the baths, having fights, being scolded, making excuses - very much like the dialogues in some of today&#39;s foreign-language textbooks. These stories provide priceless insight into daily life in the Roman empire, as well as into how Latin was learned at that period, and they were all written by Romans in Latin that was designed to be easy for beginners to understand. Learners also used special beginners&#39; versions of great Latin authors including Virgil and Cicero, and dictionaries, grammars, texts in Greek transliteration, etc. All these materials are now available for the first time to today&#39;s students, in a book designed to complement modern textbooks and enrich the Latin-learning experience.</p><p>During the Roman empire Greek speakers learned Latin using textbooks that still offer special advantages: authentic and enjoyable vignettes about the ancient world, easy Latin composed by Romans, insight into ancient learning practices.

Each chapter will start with a few introductory examples and explanation about to what to look for in the puzzles that follow.<br><br>In chapter 1, the task is to move an attacked piece. In each puzzle, there is only one good solution by moving the attacked piece to a safe square. In chapter 2, one of the kings is in check. The goal is to find the correct response. In chapter 3, a piece is attacked, but has no good square to which to move. So, rather than moving the attacked piece(s), you will need to look for a way to protect it with another piece.<br><br>In chapter 4, we focus on defensive ideas against a direct checkmate threat. In chapter 5, one side �&#x20ac;&#x153;defends�&#x20ac; by counter-attacking. In chapters 6 and 7, you will be introduced to the game-saving techniques of drawing by stalemate or perpetual check. In chapter 8, the task is to catch a pawn that is about to promote.

Not only does it keep your eyes from drying out, it serves as a momentary break from unpleasant sights and sensations. Harsh sunlight, a gory scene in a horror movie, a sudden gust of dust-�ridden air. Close your eyes, and for a second, you&#x2019;re safe and shielded.<br><br>I blink to protect my eyes from the blinding white figure invading my peripheral vision. Behind the black of my lids, I feel relief. As soon as my eyes open again, the nagging brightness is back, whiter than ever.<br><br>That whiteness is a pale coworker I don&#x2019;t particularly care for. I pretend like I can&#x2019;t see him. It&#x2019;s no big deal. I fake almost everything else when I&#x2019;m here.<br><br>I have to as a twenty-�six-�year-�old woman working at a power tool distributor called Nuts &amp; Bolts. The company is staffed mostly by middle-�aged gruff men who prefer to plaster their cubicle walls with photos of bikini models rather than pictures of their wives or girlfriends. On any given workday, I shift between a limited range of fake emotions: confidence, assertiveness, boldness. I am none of these outside of work. If I were my real self, I&#x2019;d be roadkill.<br><br>When I took this job two years ago, I ingrained fakeness into my work DNA. From 8&nbsp;a.m. to 5&nbsp;p.m., Monday through Friday, I force myself to be steely and unflappable. There&#x2019;s no room for softness here. Everything is literally nuts and bolts, hard metals, gears, blades. The parking lot is gravel. The halls are covered in a film of dust and dirt.<br><br>I have to be hard because working here is no walk in the park. Like when the managers nearing retirement age mansplain in�formation I already know but never do the same to the male employees. Or whenever new hires in the warehouse ask me if I have a boyfriend seconds after they meet me. My pretend toughness&#x2014;�boss-�bitch mode, I call it&#x2014;�keeps it mostly at bay. That, along with a strict anti&#x2013;�sexual harassment policy.<br><br>Why would I work in such a place? Because things like money, food, and shelter are important to me. Also because a journalism degree only goes so far when you don&#x2019;t actually want to be a journalist.<br><br>And to be honest, I like the work. I&#x2019;m a copywriter who somehow managed to secure my own tiny office in a building full of shared work spaces. I write descriptions about power tools. I manipulate words all day, every day. I make the most industrial, harsh objects sound enticing. I falsify how interesting they are, which is easy for a faker like me.<br><br>We all do it. Feigned interest in conversations. Phony hair color. Dishonest proclamations about penis length. Fake orgasms. I&#x2019;m guilty of that one too.<br><br>Fake can be empowering. It&#x2019;s human nature. It&#x2019;s necessary.<br><br>And then there&#x2019;s Tate Rasmussen, the pale figure bleeding into my line of sight. The one person at Nuts &amp; Bolts whose presence doesn&#x2019;t require me to pretend. I feel genuine emotions for him, all of which are rooted in frustration, anger, and irritation.<br><br>Thankfully, we reside in separate offices. The downside? His office is diagonally across the hall from mine, which means I have an unobscured view of half his face&#x2014;�just as he does of mine&#x2014;�forty hours a week. Only a narrow hallway and two flimsy doors&#x2014;�the equivalent of four paces&#x2014;�separate us.<br><br>Shutting the doors would offer more privacy, but neither of our shoebox offices contains vents. Unless we want to roast in the summer or freeze in the winter, we have to keep our doors open.<br><br>Tate&#x2019;s in charge of social media for the company. It&#x2019;s an amusing example of irony, as he is one of the most antisocial and eerily quiet people I&#x2019;ve ever met. Luckily, we don&#x2019;t interact much. Most of our communication is done via email. Face-�to-�face words are not often exchanged unless it is to bicker or criticize.<br><br>Most days I can ignore him, but this afternoon is proving to be a challenge because I&#x2019;m enduring Tate&#x2019;s loud pen tapping. When he&#x2019;s not typing or on the phone, it&#x2019;s tap, tap, tap, all day, every day.<br><br>&#x201c;Be quiet, please,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>He scribbles something on a sheet of paper before crumpling it and tossing it on my desk, zero trace of emotion on his face. I open it to find a &#x201c;NO&#x201d; scrawled in black ink, taunting me. Already I can feel the heat making its way to my face.<br><br>That&#x2019;s Tate. Cold, calculating, and hostile. His rude, dismissive behavior is his currency, and I&#x2019;m the store he chooses to shop at. I&#x2019;m paid in frowns, grimaces, scowls, and blank stares.<br><br>He&#x2019;s never once stepped foot in my office. I&#x2019;m convinced it&#x2019;s yet another one of his passive-�aggressive digs at me, since he waltzes with confidence through every other space in this building. The closest he&#x2019;s ever gotten is hovering around my doorway. I wonder what it would take for him to cross that invisible boundary. Would I need to be choking with bloodshot eyes, begging for him to administer the Heimlich?<br><br>I toss the paper into the trash can. It wasn&#x2019;t always this way. Before he started, I was asked by the hiring manager to email him a product catalog so he could familiarize himself with the inventory. His reply was nothing short of impressive.<br><br>Emmie,<br><br>Thank you for the helpful information. I&#x2019;m told working quarters will be tight, but I&#x2019;ve also heard many wonderful things about you. Looking forward to sharing space with one of Nuts &amp; Bolts&#x2019; finest.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Tate Rasmussen<br><br>On his first day, I skipped into his office, mesmerized. I couldn&#x2019;t help it. I was a moth drawn in by the glow of his white skin, his curly blond locks, broad shoulders, that sharp jaw. This handsome stranger looked so different from me, with my olive complexion and dark hair.<br><br>When I introduced myself, disgust and horror filled his face. Lines jutted into his forehead and his eyebrows pinched together, aging his late-�twenties face in an instant. Had we passed each other on the street, he would have shrieked at the sight of me and run the other way.<br><br>He weakly shook my hand, then directed his attention back to his paperwork. His instant rebuff hurt, but I chalked it up to first-�day-�of-�work nerves. It wasn&#x2019;t. Every attempt at polite small talk, every invite to lunch was met with rejection.<br><br>And then I overheard him on the phone. Through his cracked-�open door, I heard, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what to say about her. It&#x2019;s only been a week.&#x201d;<br><br>I froze. I should have plugged my ears or shoved in my headphones, but I couldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Just looking at her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Disdain dripped from his voice. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how long I&#x2019;ll be able to deal.&#x201d;<br><br>So that was it. We would never, ever like each other.<br><br>I had no idea what I did to turn him sour so quickly. I should have confronted him, but I didn&#x2019;t have the strength. I was humiliated, going out of my way to welcome someone who hated me instantly for some unknown reason. From that afternoon, I quit engaging him unless it was a work-�related issue and he was the only one who could help. We fell into a pattern of ignoring and arguing with each other.<br><br>I shove away the bitter memory and staple copies of a shopping guide I wrote. A soft squeak distracts me, and I look up to see Tate leaning back against his chair, stretching. His sleeve slides up his arm, and I catch a glimpse of skin. His paleness never ceases to wow me. Living in Nebraska, I was surrounded by countless white children in school, but Tate puts them to shame. His skin practically glows. I want to ask what SPF he uses, how long it takes him to burn when he&#x2019;s outside, but that&#x2019;s small talk, and he refuses to make it with me.<br><br>I could say his complexion makes him haggard, but it would be a lie. The lack of color actually suits him. Raphaelian-�hued skin, blond hair, eyes so light blue they&#x2019;re almost gray. His photo belongs in a travel brochure for Nordic countries. He&#x2019;s a living, breathing advertisement for that region. It&#x2019;s another reason I can&#x2019;t stand him. A person as unpleasant as Tate shouldn&#x2019;t look that good.<br><br>He catches me before I can turn away. Busted.<br><br>&#x201c;Like what you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just wondering if you burst into flame the moment you step into sunlight.&#x201d; I can feel myself blushing, but thankfully, my own tan skin conceals it.<br><br>His ever-�present neutral expression remains. I&#x2019;d wager his genes have never been infiltrated by a person of color. His ancestors must have been stationed for generations near the Arctic Circle, surrounded by the Baltic and North Seas, no tan people like me allowed entry for generations.<br><br>&#x201c;Not all of us are lucky enough to tan at the drop of a hat like you do, Emmie. What&#x2019;s your secret?&#x201d;<br><br>I ignore his sarcastic question. He&#x2019;s trying to get a rise out of me. I will not give it to him.<br><br>This is how most of our interactions go. A mix of snide comments and dismissive quips, with a sprinkle of work-�related topics every once in a while. Nothing personal.<br><br>Despite this mutual disinterest in each other&#x2019;s lives, I feel like I know him well after eleven months. He reminds me of an android in a sci-�fi movie. Cool and polite, but with a machinelike quality. Almost like he&#x2019;s feigning human reactions for courtesy&#x2019;s sake, and you can&#x2019;t tell what&#x2019;s really behind the wall of artificial feelings.<br><br>A robot would be a more pleasant coworker.<br><br>I once taped a photo of an android on his computer with the words I&#x2019;m flattered you work so hard to model your personality after mine scrawled on the bottom after a particularly infuriating day of snapping at each other. I would have loved to watch him rip it apart in anger, but I was giggling so hard I had to leave the room.<br><br>The soft tick of the minute hand on my desk clock pulls me back to the present. Only one more hour until I can go home and shed my work armor. I glance at the lone framed photo on my desk of my younger sister, my mom, and me. Addy is a toddler; I&#x2019;m just out of kindergarten. We&#x2019;re soaked from running back and forth into the waves at Hapuna Beach in Hawaii. Our mom kneels behind us, hugging us in her arms. All three of us display impossibly wide grins.<br><br>My mouth waters for Spam musubi, my favorite childhood snack. I curl my toes inside my sneakers, wishing they were sand. Nostalgia is hitting hard today. I send Mom and Addy quick &#x201c;I love you&#x201d; texts, then punch in a reminder on my phone to email Mom this weekend.<br><br>Next to the frame is a hollowed-�out coconut half, my favorite keepsake from the Big Island that doubles as a quirky paperweight. I run my fingers over the fuzzy fibers on the shell. Inside rests a message scrawled in my mother&#x2019;s trademark cursive handwriting.<br><br>For my beautiful anak, who&#x2019;s as sweet and strong as this coconut.<br><br>My eyes prick, but I blink away the split second of emotion. Remembering how and why she gave this to me will forever leave me choking back tears.<br><br>&#x201c;Missing Hawaii again?&#x201d; Tate asks.<br><br>Curse this heat. I want to shut my door so bad. &#x201c;You could say that,&#x201d; I concede.<br><br>&#x201c;Wanna talk about it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; I gaze at my computer screen and click indiscriminately on random links.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on. I&#x2019;m a good listener.&#x201d; He looks at me expectantly, like he thinks I&#x2019;m actually going to chat with him about my childhood. Fat chance.<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><br>The heavy sigh he releases sounds a lot like disappointment, but I have no idea why. Like I&#x2019;m going to divulge personal details to the guy who spends every workday staring daggers at me in between bicker sessions. He&#x2019;ll just make fun of me. Like how he smirks when I call flip-�flops &#x201c;slippers,&#x201d; or how he frowns when I say &#x201c;auntie&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;aunt.&#x201d;<br><br>Five o&#x2019;clock hits, and Tate&#x2019;s gone before I even log off my computer. I glance at his empty chair, my chest tight with the desire to have a normal work relationship with the coworker sitting closest to me. But I remind myself why it&#x2019;s not possible. He&#x2019;s weirdly hostile, and I&#x2019;m a big fat phony. As much as I want to be normal with Tate, I don&#x2019;t need it. What I do need is to be hard, focused. Even if I have to fake it.<br><br>No tapping today. Instead Tate is loudly guzzling coffee from his thermos. I want to yell after every earsplitting slurp. Every time he brings that silver thermos to his lips, I imagine ripping it out of his grip and chucking it against the wall. But I can&#x2019;t. Because this is a place of business, not a street fight.<br><br>Why is he even drinking hot coffee? It&#x2019;s ninety-�nine degrees out for the twelfth straight day, one of the hottest Augusts that Omaha has seen on record.<br><br>Another slurp. My eyes bulge. There&#x2019;s no way he doesn&#x2019;t know how grating this is. He should think about outsourcing his slurping skills to Guantanamo Bay as a new form of enhanced interrogation. He could get anyone to submit in record time.<br><br>Shoving in my earbuds, I crank the volume on the episode of Eat Bulaga! I&#x2019;m streaming, my favorite variety show from the Philippines. The hosts&#x2019; off-�key karaoke rendition of Katy Perry&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hot N Cold&#x201d; is soothing compared to Tate&#x2019;s animal noises.<br><br>Our boss, Will, glides into my doorway. He occupies a cracker box office on my side of the hallway.<br><br>&#x201c;Emmie! Good morning!&#x201d; He leans his arm against the doorframe. The weight of his pudgy dad bod pushes the flimsy door back an inch. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t seem to find the folder with the photos for that new line of utility knives. I think that software upgrade messed up something on my computer.&#x201d;<br><br>I swallow a laugh. Classic Will. He&#x2019;s a bright guy and a great boss who doesn&#x2019;t hover. However, his tendency to lose objects, even digital files, is legendary.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you grab the knives from the warehouse and take some photos of them to go along with the descriptions you wrote?&#x201d;<br><br>The thought of going to the warehouse churns my stomach. &#x201c;No problem,&#x201d; I say through gritted teeth.<br><br>Full disclosure: I&#x2019;m not some jaw-�dropping hottie by any stretch of anyone&#x2019;s imagination. But the fifty-�employee workforce here is mostly male with only five female employees. The remaining four are middle aged and married. I&#x2019;m not ugly and I&#x2019;m relatively young, so by default I get a fair amount of attention and stares.

So I went on a quest to find my own treatment. This is my story...</strong></p><p>In 1991, Glenn Sabin was a 28-year-old newlywed diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-a disease doctors called "uniformly fatal." Treatments could buy him some time and eventually ease his discomfort, but there was no conventional cure. Glenn's prognosis was clear: he was going to die.</p><p>Although Glenn and his wife, Linda, continued to consult with doctors, cancer specialists and top oncologists, Glenn made a monumental decision: he would become his own health advocate. While he continued to "watch and wait," Glenn would figure out how to stay alive.</p><p>No one could predict when a large-scale clinical trial would discover a cure for CLL, so Glenn began his own, medically monitored and carefully researched lifestyle changes. He would conduct his own, single patient clinical trial.</p><p>He would become an "<em>n of 1</em>."</p><p>Today, Glenn is not only alive, but a 2012 biopsy at Harvard confirmed that his bone marrow contains no leukemic cells. His case is now part of the medical literature.</p><p>In <em>n of 1</em>, author Glenn Sabin takes readers along his remarkable journey with 'incurable' cancer, where he discovers: </p> <ul> <li>No two cancers are exactly alike. Our bodies, minds and diseases are unique, and need to be treated as such.</li> <li>Knowledge and empowerment are your best allies against a life-limiting diagnosis.</li> <li>Lifestyle changes are a powerful way to help prevent, manage and reduce the recurrence of disease--and to improve your quality of life.</li> <li>A strong support system and a clear mind may significantly improve your health.</li> </ul> <p>https: //www.glennsabin.com</p> <p>Twitter: @GlennSabin</p> <p>LinkedIn: https: //www.linkedin.com/in/glennsabin/</p></p><p>In the early 1990s, Glenn Sabin began to develop a comprehensive and highly personalized approach to managing his chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-a disease his doctors said was incurable and would eventually take his life. Today, Glenn is alive and thriving and he has achieved a complete, medically documented remission of his CLL without conventional treatments. Glenn's remarkable case has been chronicled by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute oncologist Lee M. Nadler, MD, Dean for Clinical and Translational Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and his local Johns Hopkins oncologist Bruce R. Kressel, MD. To say Glenn's 1991 diagnosis was life-altering would be an understatement. Not only has Glenn overcome his cancer and become a staunch advocate of evidence-based, integrative medicine, in 2009 he sold his media and marketing company to launch FON Consulting-a business that supports integrative health and medicine enterprises and helps to accelerate their growth. A past board member of The Society for Integrative Oncology and an author, speaker and collaborator, Glenn is a respected thought leader who works with passion and dedication to advance the field of integrative oncology.

Drawing upon the work of anthropologists, totemists, and rationalists, he examines the supernatural practice of shapeshifting, notes the finer distinctions between werewolfery and lycanthropy, and explores the differences of opinion on exactly how ordinary humans are transformed into creatures of "unbridled cruelty, bestial ferocity, and ravening hunger." <br>The author's Gothic style, rich in fascinating examples and anecdotes, offers compelling fare for lovers of esoteric lore. Even the most skeptical of readers can appreciate the evocative ways in which <i>The Werewolf in Lore and Legend</i> conveys the dread of those for whom these monsters were not mere superstition but terrifying reality.</p><p></p><h2>Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana</h2><p><b>National Bestseller <br><br>The second novel in Anne Rice's hugely ambitious, moving, and masterful portrayal of the life of Christ, following <i>Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt</i>.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s a winter of no rain, endless dust, and talk of trouble in Judea. All who know and love Jesus find themselves waiting for some sign of the path he will eventually take. After his baptism, he is at last ready to confront his destiny. At the wedding at Cana, he takes water and transforms it into red wine.&nbsp; Thus, he&#x2019;s recognized as the anointed one and called by God the Father to begin a ministry that will transform an unsuspecting world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anne Rice&nbsp;is the author of thirty-five books. She lives in Palm Desert, California.Who is Christ the Lord?Angels sang at his birth. Magi from the East brought gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They gave these gifts to him, and to his mother, Mary, and the man, Joseph, who claimed to be his father.In the Temple, an old man gathered the babe in his arms. The old man said to the Lord, as he held the babe, &#x201c;A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.&#x201d;My mother told me those stories.That was years and years ago.Is it possible that Christ the Lord is a carpenter in the town of Nazareth, a man past thirty years of age, and one of a family of carpenters, a family of men and women and children that fill ten rooms of an ancient house, and, that in this winter of no rain, of endless dust, of talk of trouble in Judea, Christ the Lord sleeps in a worn woolen robe, in a room with other men, beside a smoking brazier? Is it possible that in that room, asleep, he dreams?Yes. I know it&#x2019;s possible. I am Christ the Lord. I know. What I must know, I know. And what I must learn, I learn.And in this skin, I live and sweat and breathe and groan. My shoulders ache. My eyes are dry from these dreadful rainless days&#x2013;from the long walks to Sepphoris through the gray fields in which the seeds burn under the dim winter sun because the rains don&#x2019;t come.I am Christ the Lord. I know. Others know, but what they know they often forget. My mother hasn&#x2019;t spoken a word on it for years. My foster father, Joseph, is old now, white haired, and given to dreaming.I never forget.And as I fall asleep, sometimes I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2013;because my dreams are not my friends. My dreams are wild like bracken or sudden hot winds that sweep down into the parched valleys of Galilee.But I do dream, as all men dream.And so this night, beside the brazier, hands and feet cold, under my cloak, I dreamed.I dreamed of a woman, close, a woman, mine, a woman who became a maiden who became in the easy tumult of dreams my Avigail.I woke. I sat up in the dark. All the others lay sleeping still, with open mouths, and the coals in the brazier were ashes.<i>Go away, beloved girl. This is not for me to know, and Christ the Lord will not know what he does not want to know&#x2013;or what he would know only by the shape of its absence.</i>She wouldn&#x2019;t go&#x2013;not this, the Avigail of dreams with hair tumbled down loose over my hands, as if the Lord had made her for me in the Garden of Eden.No. Perhaps the Lord made dreams for such knowing&#x2013; or so it seemed for Christ the Lord.I climbed up off the mat, and quietly as I could, I put more coals into the brazier. My brothers and my nephews didn&#x2019;t stir. James was off with his wife tonight in the room they shared. Little Judas and Little Joseph, fathers both, slept here tonight away from little ones huddled around their wives. And there lay the sons of James&#x2013;Menachim, Isaac, and Shabi, tumbled together like puppies.I stepped over one after another and took a clean robe from the chest, the wool smelling of the sunshine in which it had been dried. Everything in that chest was clean.I took the robe and went out of the house. Blast of cold air in the empty courtyard. Crunch of broken leaves.And for a moment in the hard pebbly street I stopped and looked up at the great sweep of glittering stars beyond the huddled rooftops.Cloudless, this cold sky, and so filled with these infinitesimal lights, it seemed for a moment beautiful. My heart hurt. It seemed to be looking at me, enfolding me&#x2013;a thing of kindness and witness&#x2013;an immense web flung out by a single hand&#x2013;rather than the vast inevitable hollow of the night above the tiny slumbering town that spilled like a hundred others down a slope between distant caves of bones and thirsting fields, and groves of olive trees.I was alone.Somewhere far down the hill, near the sometime marketplace, a man sang in a low drunken voice and a spark of light shone there, in the doorway of the sometime tavern. Echo of laughter.But all the rest was quiet, without a torch to light the way.The house of Avigail across from ours was shut up like any other. Inside, Avigail, my young kinswoman, slept with Silent Hannah, her sweet companion, and the two old women who served her and the bitter man, Shemayah, who was her father.Nazareth did not always have a beauty. I&#x2019;d seen generations of young maidens grow up, each fresh and lovely to behold as any flower in the wild. Fathers did not want their daughters to be beauties. But Nazareth had a beauty now, and it was Avigail. She&#x2019;d refused two suitors of late, or so her father had done on her behalf, and there was a real question in the minds of the women of our house as to whether Avigail herself even knew the suitors had come calling.It fell hard on me suddenly that I would sometime very soon be standing among the torchbearers at her wedding. Avigail was fifteen. She might have been married a year ago, but Shemayah kept her close. Shemayah was a rich man who had but one thing and one thing alone that made him happy, and that was his daughter, Avigail.I walked up the hill and over the top. I knew every family behind every door. I knew the few strangers who came and went, one huddled in a courtyard outside the Rabbi&#x2019;s house, and the other on the roof above where so many slept, even in winter. It was a town of day-to-day quiet, and seemingly not a single secret.I walked down the other side of the slope until I came to the spring, the dust rising with every step I took, until I was coughing from it.Dust and dust and dust.Thank You, Father of the Universe, that this night is not so cold, no, not as cold as it might be, and send us the rain in Your own good time because You know that we need it.Passing the synagogue, I could hear the spring before I saw it.The spring was drying up, but for now it still ran, and it filled the two large rock-cut basins in the side of the hill, and spilled down in glistening streaks to the rocky bed it followed off and away into the distant forest.The grass grew soft here and fragrant.I knew that in less than an hour, the women would be coming, some to fill jugs, others, the poorer women, to wash their clothes here as best they could and beat them on the rocks.But for now the spring was mine.I stripped off the old robe and flung it down into the creek bed where the water soon filled it up and darkened it to where I couldn&#x2019;t see it. I set the clean robe aside and approached the basin. With my cupped hands I bathed in the cold water, drenching my hair, my face, my chest, letting it run down my back and my legs. Yes, cast away the dreams like the old robe, and bathe them away. The dream woman has no name now and no voice, and what it was, that painful flicker when she laughed or reached out, well, that was gone, fading, like the night itself was fading, and gone too was the dust for this moment, the suffocating dust. There was only cold. There was only water.I lay down on the far bank, opposite the synagogue. The birds had begun, and as always I&#x2019;d missed the exact moment. It was a game I played, trying to hear the very first of the birds, the birds that knew the sun was coming when no one else did.I could see the big thick palm trees around the synagogue emerging from the clump of shapeless shadows. Palms could grow in a drought. Palms didn&#x2019;t care if the dust coated every branch. Palms went on as if made for all seasons.The cold was outside me. I think my beating heart kept me warm. Then the first light seeped up over the distant bluff, and I picked up the fresh robe, and slipped it over my head. So good, this, this luxuriously clean cloth, this fresh-smelling cloth.I lay back down again and my thoughts drifted. I felt the breeze before I heard the trees sigh with it.Far up the hill was an old olive grove to which I loved to go at times to be alone. I thought of it now. How good it would be to lie in that soft bed of dead leaf and sleep the day away.But there was no chance of it, not now with the tasks that had to be done, and with the village charged with new worries and new talk over a new Roman Governor come to Judea, who, until he settled in as every other Governor had done, would trouble the land from one end to the other.The land. When I say the land, I mean Judea and Galilee as well. I mean the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, the Land of God. It was no matter that this man didn&#x2019;t govern us. He governed Judea and the Holy City where the Temple stood, and so he might as well have been our King instead of Herod Antipas. They worked together, these two, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, and this new man, Pontius Pilate, whom men feared, and beyond Jordan Herod Philip ruled and worked with them as well. And so the land had been carved up for a long, long time, and Antipas and Philip we knew, but Pontius Pilate we didn&#x2019;t know and the reports were already evil.What could a carpenter in Nazareth do about it? Nothing, but when there was no rain, when men were restive and angry and full of fear, when people spoke of the curse of Heaven on the withering grass, and Roman slights, and an anxious Emperor gone into exile in mourning for a son poisoned, when all the world seemed filled with the pressure to put one&#x2019;s shoulder to it and push, well, in such a time, I didn&#x2019;t go off to the grove of trees to sleep the day away.It was getting light.A figure broke from the dark shapes of the houses of the village, hurrying downhill towards me, one hand upraised. My brother James. Older brother&#x2013;son of Joseph and Joseph&#x2019;s first wife who died before Joseph married my mother. No mistaking James, for his long hair, knotted at the back of his neck and streaming down his back, and his narrow anxious shoulders and the speed with which he came, James the Nazirite, James, the captain of our band of workers, James, who now in Joseph&#x2019;s old age was head of the family.He stopped at the far side of the little spring, mostly a broad swatch of dry stones now with the glittering ribbon of water gurgling through the center of it, and I could plainly make out his face as he stared at me. He stepped on one big stone after another as he came across the creek to me. I had sat up and now I climbed to my feet, a common enough courtesy for my older brother. &#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with you? Why do you always worry me?&#x201d;I didn&#x2019;t say anything.He threw up his hands and looked to the trees and the fields for an explanation.&#x201c;When will you take a wife?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t stop me, don&#x2019;t put up your hand to me to silence me. I will not be silenced. When will you take a wife? Are you wed to this miserable creek, to this cold water? What will you do when it runs dry, and it will this year, you know.&#x201d;I laughed under my breath.He went right on.&#x201c;There are two men as old as you in this town who&#x2019;ve never married. One is crippled. The other&#x2019;s an idiot, and everyone knows this.&#x201d;He was right. I was past thirty and not married.&#x201c;How many times have we talked about this, James?&#x201d; I asked.It was a beautiful thing to watch the growing light, to see the color coming to the palms clustered around the synagogue. I thought I heard shouting in the distance. But perhaps it was just the usual noises of a town tearing off its blankets.&#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s really eating at you this morning?&#x201d; I asked. I picked up the wet robe from the stream and spread it out on the grass where it would dry. &#x201c;Every year you come to look more like your father,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you never have your father&#x2019;s face really. You never have his peace of mind.&#x201d;&#x201c;I was born worried,&#x201d; he confessed with a shrug. He was looking anxiously towards the village. &#x201c;Do you hear that?&#x201d;&#x201c;I hear something,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;This is the worst dry spell we&#x2019;ve ever had,&#x201d; he said, glancing up at the sky. &#x201c;And cold as it is, it&#x2019;s not cold enough. You know the cisterns are almost empty. The mikvah&#x2019;s almost empty. And you, you are a constant worry to me, Yeshua, a constant worry. You come out here in the dark to the creek. You go off to that grove where no one dares to go. . . .&#x201d;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re wrong about that grove,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Those old stones mean nothing.&#x201d; That was a village superstition, that something pagan and dreadful had once taken place in that grove. But it was the mere ruins of an old olive press in there, stones that went way back to the years before Nazareth had been Nazareth. &#x201c;I tell you this once a year, don&#x2019;t I? But I don&#x2019;t want to worry you, James.&#x201d;</p><h2>Van Gogh: His Life &amp; Works in 500 Images</h2><p>This comprehensive new book is an essential volume for anyone who wants to learn more about this intriguing artist, and to survey their greatest works in one beautfully illustrated collection.</p><p>Michael Howard has studied secret societies since 1964 and is an expert on Anglo-Saxon runes.

With illustrations by Jason Polan.</b><br><br>The seven years between the birth of Etgar Keret&#x2019;s son and the death of his father were good years, though still full of reasons to worry. Lev is born in the midst of a terrorist attack. Etgar&#x2019;s father gets cancer. The threat of constant war looms over their home and permeates daily life.<br><br>What emerges from this dark reality is a series of sublimely absurd ruminations on everything from Etgar&#x2019;s three-year-old son&#x2019;s impending military service to the terrorist mind-set behind Angry Birds. There&#x2019;s Lev&#x2019;s insistence that he is a cat, releasing him from any human responsibilities or rules. Etgar&#x2019;s siblings, all very different people who have chosen radically divergent paths in life, come together after his father&#x2019;s shivah to experience the grief and love that tie a family together forever. This wise, witty memoir&#x2014;Etgar&#x2019;s first nonfiction book published in America, and told in his inimitable style&#x2014;is full of wonder and life and love, poignant insights, and irrepressible humor.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Etgar Keret is not your usual memoirist. For his first foray into the genre&#x2014;he is the author of several lauded short story collections&#x2014;Keret chose the titular <em>Seven Good Years</em> between the birth of his son and the death of his father as temporal boundaries for a series of four- to five-page vignettes and ruminations, ranging from humorous to anxious (but humorous) to heavy (and humorous). And for the most part, those events don&#x2019;t even define the content of this collection. Keret&#x2014;a native of Israel&#x2014;contemplates moments of his life against a backdrop of constant conflict, casting an absurd light on both the monumental and mundane: a time-wasting game of chicken with a telemarketer becomes an irritating <em>memento mori</em>; the terrorist subtext of Angry Birds comes disturbingly (if somewhat speciously) clear; a whimsical mustache conjures a story of a near-fatal encounter in Lebanon. His compact style benefits the brevity of the pieces, perfectly matching his skewed and occasionally detached tone; Keret is a sort of bemused and sometimes baffled observer of the world and the people who inhabit it, and simply a wonderful writer. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p><b>Etgar&nbsp;Keret</b>&nbsp;was born in Ramat Gan and now lives in Tel Aviv.

It was just one year ago that she and her team of marine biologists had stunned the world with their incredible breakthrough. And now...they were about to do it again. But an ocean away, something strange was unfolding. Along a lonely coast in South America, an experimental Russian submarine -- long thought to have been dismantled -- has suddenly resurfaced. And the U.S. Navy has taken notice, sending officers John Clay and Steve Caesare to investigate. The sub has been studying a group of unmarked soldiers. Disappearing into the jungle each night beneath the cover of darkness. Something has been discovered. Something big.

We Misunderstood: Interpreting Genesis 1 in Its Original Context</h2><p>For years, the evangelical church and its members have debated whether the Bible should be interpreted literally or symbolically in regards to the age of the earth. In their groundbreaking new book, In the Beginning . . . We Misunderstood, authors Johnny V. Miller and John M. Soden say that all these arguments have missed the point. Rather, what Christians really need to know is how to interpret the Bible in its original context.<p> Exposing the fallacies of trying to make the biblical text fit a specific scientific presupposition, Miller and Soden offer a new approach to interpreting Genesis 1 that explores the creation account based on how the original audience would have understood its teaching. First, the authors present a clear explanation of the past and present issues in interpreting the first chapter of the Bible. Second, Miller and Soden break down the creation account according to its historical and cultural context by comparing and distinguishing both the Egyptian and Mesopotamian settings. Finally, they explore common objections to help readers understand the significance that the creation account has for theology today.</p><p> Christians need not look any further than Genesis 1 to find clues to its meaning. Both irenic and bathed in Scripture, <i>In the Beginning . . . We Misunderstood</i> will equip every believer to navigate the creation wars, armed with biblically sound explanations.</p></p><p>Johnny V.

That Fred Jones invented the refrigerated truck that makes supermarkets possible? Or that Dr. Percy Julian synthesized cortisone from soy, easing untold people&#x2019;s pain?

During that time I was immersed in black history and the many courageous African-Americans that history books had overlooked. I was surprised at how many inventors that affected our everyday life had been left out of what we learned in school. I knew at that time that I would someday want to do something about that inequity.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Super Soaker or Illusion Transmitter? Of the many inventions you talk about in the book, which is your favorite?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> My favorite invention in the book is the foil-electret microphone invented by James West because it has made cell phone communication possible. The cell phone has completely changed our world. Today&#x2019;s kids can&#x2019;t imagine a time before there were cell phones or iPods or iPads. But all that was possible, in part, thanks to one black man who had to struggle against great odds to achieve his dream. Those are the kind of men and women we should be exposing our children to.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In <i>What Color is My World?</i> Herbie keeps a journal with him all the time--do you keep a journal?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I don&#x2019;t keep a journal, but I do tweet on Twitter and have a Facebook site, which are the modern equivalents. However, Herbie&#x2019;s journal is the kind I would have kept and wish I had as a child. It&#x2019;s filled with the sense of wonder he has about the world. I had that same sense of wonder but I was a little too restless to write it all down. I&#x2019;m trying to make up for all that now with the books I write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was your favorite class in school?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I don&#x2019;t think it will be any surprise that my favorite class was history. I&#x2019;ve said many times that if I hadn&#x2019;t become a professional basketball player, I would have become a history teacher. There&#x2019;s so much to learn from history. The saying, &#x201c;Those that don&#x2019;t learn from history are condemned to repeat it&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t just apply to politicians and world leaders, it applies to all of us on a daily basis. We can learn from mistakes of others, whether they&#x2019;re kings or our parents. When we do learn those lessons, we&#x2019;re better equipped to make our own dreams come true.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What do you most want kids to know about you outside of your legendary basketball career?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I love basketball, but playing basketball doesn&#x2019;t fully define who I am. I was always a good student, too. Sure, I could have skated by as an athlete, but the world is so much bigger and more interesting than any one thing. I didn&#x2019;t want to be pigeonholed as just a jock. I&#x2019;m also an author, a student of history, and I collect memorabilia from the Wild West. I&#x2019;m also a son, a father, and a friend.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you read a lot as a kid? Did you have any favorite books growing up?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I read a lot as a kid. Some of my favorite books were <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> by Robert Louis Stevenson, <em>The Three Musketeers</em> by Alexander Dumas and <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i> by Rudyard Kipling. Reading opened up the world like nothing else. One day I might be sword fighting in 17th Century France, the next I might be fighting off crazed assassins in 19th Century India. Video games just can&#x2019;t compare with the variety and intensity of reading.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was it like to receive the Abraham Lincoln Medal [awarded to individuals who exemplify President Abraham Lincoln's commitment to equality in their body of work, accomplishments or personal attributes] and meet the President and First Lady?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> It was a great honor, truly unforgettable. One of the great things about growing older is that you can see some of your childhood dreams about the world come true. When I was a kid I imagined a day when we would have an African-American president. I imagined a day when children of all races would play together without fear or prejudice. The world isn&#x2019;t perfect, but we&#x2019;re heading in the right direction and I just want to play my part in making this a better world. I hope my books are a step in that direction.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Will you write more books for kids? If so, do you have an idea for the next one yet?</p> <p><b>Abdul-Jabbar:</b> I have so many ideas I&#x2019;d like to tackle. There&#x2019;s no shortage in my imagination. History is filled with so many amazing people and I would like to bring them to light so they can inspire all of us--young and old--to become the kind of people we want to be.</p><b>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</b> is one of the most famous and accomplished basketball players in U.S. history.

But as David F. Labaree reminds us in this book, it&#x2019;s always been that way. And that&#x2019;s exactly why it has become the most successful and sought-after source of learning in the world. Detailing American higher education&#x2019;s unusual struggle for survival in a free market that never guaranteed its place in society&#x2014;a fact that seemed to doom it in its early days in the nineteenth century&#x2014;he tells a lively story of the entrepreneurial spirit that drove American higher education to become the best.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> And the best it is: today America&#x2019;s universities and colleges produce the most scholarship, earn the most Nobel prizes, hold the largest endowments, and attract the most esteemed students and scholars from around the world. But this was not an inevitability. Weakly funded by the state, American schools in their early years had to rely on student tuition and alumni donations in order to survive. This gave them tremendous autonomy to seek out sources of financial support and pursue unconventional opportunities to ensure their success. As Labaree shows, by striving as much as possible to meet social needs and fulfill individual ambitions, they developed a broad base of political and financial support that, grounded by large undergraduate programs, allowed for the most cutting-edge research and advanced graduate study ever conducted. As a result, American higher education eventually managed to combine a unique mix of the populist, the practical, and the elite in a single complex system.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The answers to today&#x2019;s problems in higher education are not easy, but as this book shows, they shouldn&#x2019;t be: no single person or institution can determine higher education&#x2019;s future. It is something that faculty, administrators, and students&#x2014;adapting to society&#x2019;s needs&#x2014;will determine together, just as they have always done.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>David F. Labaree </b>is professor in the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University. He is the author of many books, including, most recently, <i>The Trouble with Ed Schools</i> and <i>Someone Has to Fail</i>.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>A Perfect Mess&nbsp;</i>is a concise history that has&nbsp;a point. Labaree argues there is method to America&#x2019;s higher education madness, and we are well advised to stay the course, however madcap that course can be. Well written, erudite, thoughtful, and engaging.&#x201d; (William Tierney, past president for the American Educational Research Association and Association for the Study of Higher Education)<br><br>&#x201c;Nearly five million international students attend US universities, more than in any other country, yet Labaree&#x2019;s book on the history of American higher education is called <i>A Perfect Mess</i>. This contradiction is one of many paradoxes that Labaree takes up in clear, crisp language. US universities are populist yet elitist, extend opportunity yet protect privilege, and are a public good yet also a private one offered to American young adults. Labaree&#x2019;s parsing of these historical paradoxes becomes a yellow flashing light to anyone with plans to transform US universities. Understanding how American universities, the envy of the world, became <i>A Perfect Mess</i> should give pause to those reform-minded policymakers and politicians who, uninformed by the past, want to alter the landscape and mechanics of American higher education.&#x201d; (Larry Cuban, author of Teaching History Then and Now)<br><br>&#x201c;This book will be of interest to anyone concerned with the state of higher education in the United States&#x2014;especially to those who are open to seeing the usual opinions strongly challenged. In fluid prose Labaree presents new and compelling insights into the dynamics behind the success of the American system&#x2014;or non-system&#x2014;of higher education, several of which will be sure to raise eyebrows and prompt debate.&#x201d; (Paul Reitter, coeditor of The Rise of the Research University)<br><br>&#x201c;American higher education evolved under pressures (and opportunities) from multiple sources, not under a single authority. Labaree provides a fine review of this history, showing how it generated a great and expansive dynamism.&nbsp;Applying this perspective to the present situation, he shows how the apparent disorder of current higher education can be seen as enabling continuing adaptation rather than breakdown.&nbsp;His ideas will be of great interest to all those concerned with the evolution of higher education in this country.&#x201d; (John W. Meyer, Stanford University)</p><h2>Such a Pretty Girl</h2><p>A darkly compelling novel about a young woman who must defend herself against her abusive father. &#x201c;In the character of Meredith, Laura Wiess has created a girl to walk alongside Harper Lee&#x2019;s Scout and J.D. Salinger&#x2019;s Phoebe. Read this novel, and you will be changed forever&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Luanne Rice).<br><br>They promised Meredith nine years of safety, but only gave her three.<br> <br> Her father was supposed to be locked up until Meredith turned eighteen. She thought she had time to grow up, get out, and start a new life. But Meredith is only fifteen, and today her father is coming home from prison.<br> <br> Today her time has run out.</p><p>Laura Wiess is the author of the critically acclaimed novels <i>Such a Pretty Girl</i>, chosen as one of the ALA&#x2019;s 2008 Best Books for Young Adults and 2008 YALSA Quick Picks for Reluctant Readers, and <i>Leftovers</i>. Originally from Milltown, New Jersey, she traded bumper-to-bumper traffic, excellent pizza, and summer days down the shore for scenic roads, bears, no pizza delivery, and the irresistible allure of an old stone house surrounded by forests in Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Endless Mountains Region. Email Laura Wiess at laura@laurawiess.com or visit http://www.laurawiess.com for more information.With her father imprisoned, 15-year-old Meredith thinks she could live out her high-school days safely, but when he is released early for good behavior, her security is shattered. A popular youth baseball coach, her father has abused Mer as well as other boys and girls. With strict orders that he not be left alone with his daughter, he is returned to the condo complex where she and her mother live. In contrast to Mer's terror, her mother is giddy with delight at his return, and together the reunited couple plans to conceive another child. Yet in the shadows and stillness, Mer's nightmare begins anew. This is a gritty, terrifying novel about a father's abuse of power and trust, and the way two different teens, Meredith and her paraplegic friend, Andy, deal with that reality. Although not explicit, the novel is honest in its telling. Admittedly sensational, Wiess' story is a page-turner that ultimately sends a startling message of empowerment that, while improbable, is extremely satisfying. <i>Frances Bradburn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The typical term before PTSD was "shell shock," and it was only considered as a weakness in soldiers. PTSD was first considered a disorder when Vietnam War veterans returned with the symptoms listed below, which later became the basis for diagnosis.</p> <p>The essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms in the senses of the individual following exposure to an extremely traumatic stressor. The stressor usually involves being a part of or witnessing an event of horrific magnitude. The traditional symptoms of PTSD include:</p> <ul> <li>Nightmares of past traumatic events</li> <li>Flashbacks</li> <li>Triggers of physical and psychological stresses</li> <li>Avoidance of any reminders of similar stimuli</li> <li>Isolation from others</li> <li>Emotional numbing</li> <li>Outbursts of anger or irrational rage</li> <li>Problems in concentration and focus</li> <li>Hypervigilance for triggers or paranoid thinking</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From a rational point of view, all these symptoms seem simple and straightforward, but they are not. There are few treatments that actually show documented benefit in healing PTSD.</p> <p>Medications for depression and anxiety are usually the frontline treatment. Group therapy has also been a mainline approach, especially with the integration of desensitization techniques. But nothing so far has produced a cure.</p> <p><b>The PTSD Nightmare</b></p> <p>There are a daunting number of veterans with PTSD in this nation, with more than eight hundred thousand diagnosed and countless others who have not sought help as thousands of soldiers continue to return home from war. These numbers will cause a seismic shift in our society by the sheer economic cost of care and loss of human capital. This is our national burden, and it's our responsibility to help these men and women. It's also our responsibility to help the families of these soldiers.</p> <p>The children of veterans with the diagnosis of PTSD are much more likely to have problems in school and trouble with legal boundaries. The experience of having one of your parents become dysfunctional is troublesome enough for a child, but to be emotionally cut off from affection and guidance in understanding your own mixed-up feelings about the world has to be considered as some level of neglect. With spouses suffering from mental health problems, family structures are strained and collapsing at an epidemic rate. PTSD is not just a problem among our soldiers and their families. PTSD is considered an anxiety reaction to trauma of <i>any </i>kind. It can truly happen to anyone.</p> <p>Luci was brutally raped when she was just fifteen and is still having debilitating nightmares almost every night at age twenty-five. In public, she finds herself hiding from people in closets or nooks, anywhere she can find to feel safe. She is an attractive woman, yet she purposefully dresses poorly to keep men from approaching her. She tries to gorge herself with fattening food to make herself even more unattractive. Therapy is frustrating because she wants to forget the traumatic event, but it seems like the goal of the available therapies is to force her to relive the rape over and over so that she can process her fears about it.</p> <p>Bill, age fifty-five, was losing sleep because every time he would get comfortable, his doctor's face and voice would invade his consciousness. His mind would immediately go back to the moment he was told he had cancer. When he could finally get some sleep with the help of medication, he would dream of horrible deaths and the nightmares would wake him. He is now afraid of all medical consultations, even those that might help him. He has lost his strong faith in God, feeling betrayed and bitter about these events. He wants to know why this is happening to him. Sometimes, in a fit of anger, he throws things at his wife or lashes out at friends just because they are healthy and happy. With the additional stress caused by PTSD, his immune system is being compromised, which will likely increase his cancer's growth.</p> <p>Do these people sound like someone you know? Perhaps it is you, your spouse, or a friend. There is a one out of ten chance that you or someone you know will develop PTSD during your lifetime. It's twice as likely if you experience a significant trauma and three to four times as likely if you are involved in some kind of disaster.</p> <p>It has been shown that the citizens of New York City had a 12.6 percent rate of PTSD due to their close association with the terrorist attack of 9/11. If they were directly involved at any level, the rate shot up to 38 percent. High rates of PTSD are found in professionals who deal with shock, such as trauma counselors, police, firemen, and case workers. And one of the largest populations of people with PTSD is, of course, our soldiers.</p> <p>The saddest story of all is that, until now, there have been no significant medical approaches to the resolution of PTSD since the diagnosis came into use more than forty years ago. There simply have been no answers. And time is running out. On average, there are three deaths by suicide each day from veterans alone. More than one thousand attempt to end their lives every month. Although the armed forces count approximately five thousand casualties in recent wars, if you include these suicides and suicide attempts, the number would be closer to seventy thousand.</p> <p>The two most common treatment approaches for PTSD, medicine and psychotherapy, are not working. Zoloft and Paxil are the only two medications that have been approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD. But many believe they are contributing to the problem rather than helping it. The labels of these medications warn of a significant risk of suicide. Should we then be surprised that two out of every five veterans who commit suicide were taking these medications? The bottom line: Medication is not the answer.</p> <p>The other option offered as a solution is psychotherapy. But like Luci, many people with PTSD are not ready to explore painful times again. They are already isolating themselves from their community, friends, and loved ones, so the last thing they want to do is sit in a closed-in office with a stranger for long periods of time. And as strange as it might sound, PTSD isn't cured by exploring feelings or even experiencing reminders of the horrible events that were undergone. These tactics are contraindicated in professional psychotherapy because they require the person to relive the painful event in his or her mind without proper preparation or the skill sets to manage the stress that follows. In spite of the research and poor outcomes, old practices are hard to change. This approach is not helpful, at least in the beginning, which is where we are right now.</p> <p>So what is the solution to helping those with PTSD?</p></p><h2>RETURN OF WOLVERINE</h2><p>Wolverine's body has been missing.

A stranger named Jed Parry joins Rose in helping to bring the balloon to safety, but unknown to Rose, something passes between Parry and himself on that day&#x2014;something that gives birth to an obsession in Parry so powerful that it will test the limits of Rose's beloved rationalism, threaten the love of his wife, Clarissa, and drive him to the brink of murder and madness. From the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>Atonement</i>, here is a brilliant and compassionate novel of love, faith, and suspense, and of how life can change in an instant.</p><p>Joe Rose has planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside to celebrate his lover's return after six weeks in the States. To complete the picture, there's even a "helium balloon drifting dreamily across the wooded valley." But as Joe and Clarissa watch the balloon touch down, their idyll comes to an abrupt end. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. As the wind whips into action, Joe and four other men rush to secure the basket. Mother Nature, however, isn't feeling very maternal. "A mighty fist socked the balloon in two rapid blows, one-two, the second more vicious than the first," and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do most of his companions, but one man is lifted sky-high, only to fall to his death. <p> In itself, the accident would change the survivors' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. (In one of the novel's many ironies, the balloon eventually lands safely, the boy unscathed.) But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that very night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, "I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable.") Worst of all, Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa. </p><p> Apart from the incessant stalking, it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe, a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in defamiliarization. But <i>Enduring Love</i> and its underrated predecessor, <i>Black Dogs</i>, are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel's end, you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons, but you won't be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye.</p>"Vibrant and unsettling...a tour de force."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"Brilliant...a marvellous fiction...an imaginative reconstruction of a superior kind."--Anita Brookner</p><p>"McEwan has fashioned a remarkable novel, haunting and original and written in prose that anyone who writes can only envy."--<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"Cleverly imagined, beautifully executed...a pleasure to read...[McEwan] has few peers."--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Get Ready to Get Pregnant: Your Complete Prepregnancy Guide to Making a Smart and Healthy Baby</h2><p><p> Doctors and researchers are increasingly learning that by the time a woman gets pregnant, she may have already missed a critical window of opportunity to give her baby the best start in life.

This idea lays the foundations for modern contract theory. In this book, leading feminist political theorist Carole Pateman revealed for the first time that we were only given half the story. The sexual contract that established men's patriarchal right over women has been glossed over, and no attention is paid to the problems that arise when women are excluded from the original contract but incorporated into the new contractual order. Pateman's critique of the traditional social contract continues to be relevant to discussions about the marriage contract and the employment contract, as well as newer cases, such as the welfare contract and the environmental contract. With an updated preface by the author, this edition speaks to ever-important questions about freedom and subordination.</p><p><b>Carole Pateman</b> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Though Part 2 echoes the structure of the earlier play, it is a darker and more unsettling world, in which even Falstaff's revelry is more tired and cynical, and the once-merry Hal sloughs off his tavern companions to become King Henry V. </p><p>James C. Bulman's authoritative edition provides a wealth of incisive commentary on this complex history play.</p></p><p><b>James C.

Bulman&#x2019;s new Arden edition does not merely give textual scholars a tight text and graduate students an authoritative survey of sources and theatrical history.

But the no-nonsense Philadelphia criminal attorney isn&#x2019;t interested&#x2015;until she meets the accused killer face to face&#x2015;and can&#x2019;t believe what she sees. Alice claims she&#x2019;s Bennie twin&#x2015;and the woman does bear an uncanny resemblance to her. But Bennie grew up an only child. She doesn&#x2019;t have a sister. Or does she? </p><p></p><p>Agreeing to take the case, Bennie plunges into the mystery of the murder and into the depths of her own past&#x2015;a twisting search for justice and the truth that will keep the seasoned attorney guessing and leave readers breathless until the verdict is in.</p></p><p>When confronted with the most challenging and the most personal case of her legal career, Bennie Rosato--an expert on police corruption--questions everything she has learned as a criminal attorney, and everyone she considers to be family. During a visit behind the bars of Philadelphia's Central Corrections facility, Bennie is shocked to discover that an inmate bears a striking physical resemblance to herself. The prisoner, Alice Connolly, stands accused of murdering her cop boyfriend Anthony Della Porta, and the case reeks of a police conspiracy. Connolly convinces Bennie to defend her in court. Bennie feels confused, intrigued, and even somewhat elated by this clone of herself, and dives head first into a bubbling cauldron of corruption, drugs, murder, and assault--mixed in with a thought-provoking subplot that questions the intricacies of legal ethics. <p> <i>Mistaken Identity</i> is Lisa Scottoline's sixth and tastiest dish yet. The book is gripping and smart, and it brings into bloom the highly likable character of Bennie Rosato, who made her debut appearance in <i>Legal Tender</i>. Bennie has her vulnerable moments--we witness this when, in some emotional scenes, she doubts the authenticity of her twin. Still, Ms. Rosato is no shrinking violet, especially when it comes to exposing the questionable goings-on of Philadelphia's Eleventh Precinct. </p><p> Scottoline keeps us in a bubble of suspense--is Connolly really Bennie's twin? Did she murder Della Porta? If not, who did and why? The author neatly ties all our unanswered questions together into a perfectly formed bow, and keeps us frantically turning pages until the very end. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p><p>Bennie Rosato thought she had seen it all&#x2014;until she meets her new client, Alice Connolly, who looks exactly like Bennie and tells her, "Hello, I'm your twin." A shocked Bennie can't deny the uncanny resemblance, but she grew up an only child and assumed she didn't have a sister, much less an identical twin. But Alice seems to know too much for it to be a scam, and Bennie can't walk away. She agrees to defend Alice on a murder charge and plunges into the mystery of the crime&#x2014;unraveling a twisted skein of lies, greed, and danger that jeopardizes her livelihood and ultimately even her life. At the same time, she uncovers the truth of her own identity, a secret that will leave her questioning everything she ever knew about her family&#x2014;and herself.</p></p><h2>Ivory Vikings: The Mystery of the Most Famous Chessmen in the World and the Woman Who Made Them</h2><p><p>In the early 1800s, on a Hebridean beach in Scotland, the sea exposed an ancient treasure cache: 93 chessmen carved from walrus ivory. Norse netsuke, each face individual, each full of quirks, the Lewis Chessmen are probably the most famous chess pieces in the world. Harry played Wizard&#x2019;s Chess with them in <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone</i>. Housed at the British Museum, they are among its most visited and beloved objects.</p><p>Questions abounded: Who carved them? Where? <i>Ivory Vikings </i>by Nancy Marie Brown explores these mysteries by connecting medieval Icelandic sagas with modern archaeology, art history, forensics, and the history of board games. In the process, Ivory Vikings presents a vivid history of the 400 years when the Vikings ruled the North Atlantic, and the sea-road connected countries and islands we think of as far apart and culturally distinct: Norway and Scotland, Ireland and Iceland, and Greenland and North America. The story of the Lewis chessmen explains the economic lure behind the Viking voyages to the west in the 800s and 900s. And finally, it brings from the shadows an extraordinarily talented woman artist of the twelfth century: Margret the Adroit of Iceland.</p></p><p>NANCY MARIE BROWN is the author of highly praised books of nonfiction, including<i> Song of the Vikings. </i>She is fluent in Icelandic and spends her summers in Iceland. She has deep ties to the Scandinavian cultural institutions in the U.S. Brown lives in East Burke, VT.<p>"Brown...believes the [Lewis] chessmen were carved in Iceland by a master craftswoman, Margaret the Adroit, reputed at the time to be the best carver in Iceland and who worked for Bishop Pall of Skalholt.

Renowned Norse scholar Nancy Marie Brown follows the Lewis chessmen's trail back to a 12th century master named Margret the Adroit. Piece by piece, Brown also peels back a millennia of history to explore the Norse world's interlocking social facets -- kings, queens, berserkers, nobles, bishops and poets -- that populated Viking society much as these carved ivory pieces populated a chessboard.

Someone will be talking to me and I look like I'm listening, but really all I'm doing is drawing one line of the star for every one word that person says. Our conversation has to end on a multiple of 5, a complete star. My husband might say to me, "What do you want for dinner?" I'm looking him straight in the eyes so I guess he believes I'm deciding, but in fact I'm drawing and thinking 1 and 1/5 stars. He says, "How about pizza?" I still just stare at him, but think 1 and 4/5 stars. He continues, "Do you have any idea?" 2 and 4/5. Finally he'll conclude, "Why don't we just make pasta?" 4 stars.</p><p>CLEAN TIME</p><p>It had been almost a decade since I'd taken a pill and I was not thrilled to find myself about to swallow one. I just stood in front of the sink for a minute or two and then got up the nerve to stick it in the back of my throat and drink it down. I imagined the outer casing was starting to dissolve and the powder inside was filtering up to my brain. I was waiting for somethingdramatic to happen. Maybe I'd fall down in convulsions or start hallucinating. Maybe I'd be overcome with the urge to kill my husband.</p><p>In college, I'd had a nasty drug habit and the unfortunate experience of a bad trip. After that night, I suffered from flashbacks for a few months and vowed never to take a pill again, harmful or otherwise. When I was pregnant, I relented and took vitamins. After I had kids, Advil. Several years later, today, I was moving on to this serious medication. I was a little shaky. It was probably the drug.</p><p>IN THE BEGINNING</p><p>My husband and I went to a bar for our first date. We were pretty young at the time, both in school. We, sat next to each other at a table in the back of the place. The lights were low, cigarette smoke clouded the room. Lots of atmosphere. We spent the night talking with our heads really close and our fingers twisted together. We had both just ended serious relationships so we wanted to take this slow. After the drinks, we went back to his place and stayed up for hours while he read poetry to me. Then we fell asleep, him on the couch, me in his bed.</p><p>YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?</p><p>I used to sit dazed at the table watching my father eat breakfast. It was always the same meal, toast, eggs, bacon and juice, which he'd always eat the same way, bite of toast, bite of eggs, bite of bacon, sip of juice. Bite of toast, bite of eggs, bite of bacon, sip of juice. My head would follow his hand around from his plate to his mouth, to his cup, to his mouth, to his plate...around and around until he'd finished. I'd have to shake my head and blink my eyes to snap out of my trance.</p><p>I SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH...</p><p>You never know what kind of things people have going on in their lives. Secret things that you have no idea about. The woman who dry-cleans your clothes? Prostitute. The man who sells you coffee and a doughnut? Serial killer. And your friend who hasn't returned your calls lately? Heroin addict. And then I find out that my friend wasn't returning my calls because she was in rehab. Which I'll admit is a little jarring. I pretty much assumed that people just spill everything. I do. Maybe that's wrong. Maybe I shouldn't. How are you supposed to know what to tell and what not to tell? Maybe my dry cleaner really is a prostitute. Maybe I should stick to cotton. I feel confused. And of course bad for my friend who it turns out had been addicted to heroin for five years and was now trying to kick methadone. She says that she wanted to tell me, and almost did a couple of times, but she was just too embarrassed. I totally understand. But that still leaves this whole honesty issue unresolved.</p><p>DINNER AT SEVEN</p><p>I've often been told this story of when my family went out for a Sunday night dinner, I was seven at the time, and I started making jokes about a woman I noticed who was a dwarf. After what I assume were a few uncomfortable minutes for my relatives, my aunt, wanting to put an end to my mocking, turned to me and said, "It's not nice to make fun of people, but if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them for you." I sat there for a minute or two with I guess a pensive look on my face and then said, "Do you think she was normal until she was seven and then she got like that?" I'm sure my aunt answered no, but that still left open the question of what I would turn into.</p><p>AND DINNER AT 7:00</p><p>For our second date, my husband invited me over for dinner. This was going to be our first problem. I'd been under the impression of late that people were putting acid in my food. The kind that makes you hallucinate. This started a few months before when I was at a party and a friend of mine was eating sugar cubes from a bowl on the table. The hostess of the party yelled to him, "Don't eat that! It's where we put our acid!" My friend got this horrified look on his face, because by that point he'd probably had about ten hits. Then the hostess started laughing. Sure she was just kidding, but something like that could happen; you might accidentally eat someone's stash or maybe some malicious dealer with an attitude wants a laugh. As a result, I had stopped going to restaurants and dinner parties and just ate prepackaged food. It hadn't affected my life too much until this point, but I liked this guy. I could see myself getting serious about him. I figured that this was going to be our first trust test. I showed up at seven.</p><p>"Hey, I'm glad to see you. How was your day?" he asked as he softly touched my arm and slid his hand down to hold mine.</p><p>"Okay." I was pretty nervous. I wasn't sure if it was second-date anxiety, fear of my impending trip or both. "How about yours?" He started talking about what he'd been up to, his classes, the paper he was working on. I was looking at him and I thought I was listening, but truly, I was distracted by the smell of the cooking food in the next room. Being reminded of what was in store for me.</p><p>"I have to go check on dinner. Can I bring you a drink?" he asked.</p><p>"No thanks. Do you need any help?" Maybe I could monitor. Make sure he didn't slip anything into the sauce.</p><p>"No, I'm good."</p><p>Twenty minutes later he brought out dinner and set it on the table. Chicken and rice. We sat down. I shuffled the food around with my fork for a minute or two and eventually got up the nerve to cut a piece of chicken and spear it when he said, "I forgot the salt." He disappeared into the kitchen and I had this dilemma. I had about five seconds to decide whether or not to switch our plates. If he had laced my food, this was going to be my last meal before I was chopped up into little pieces and hidden out back. I didn't know if I should chance it. I did want to start this relationship on the right foot, but that's pretty hard to do looking up from the ground in a thousand pieces. He seemed like a nice guy, but don't a lot of serial killers? Ted Bundy. The clown guy. But there were other considerations. If he had poisoned my food, and I switched the plates, then he would die and I'd get questioned by the police.</p><p>"Um, ma'am, we found a horse dose of cyanide in your boyfriend's food. How do you suppose it got in there?" He'd have done the bad thing, but, unable to prove my innocence, I'd end up in jail. Plus, I'm not sure the cops would be patient enough to wait for me to answer them until I had completed a star.</p><p>"Ma'am. Could you answer our questions? Why aren't you speaking to us? Do you want a lawyer? Ma'am? Hello."</p><p>8 stars. "I didn't do it. I switched the plates. I'm innocent..." </p><p>No. Don't think that way. Trust. Besides, he'd eaten more than I had and maybe he'd notice. I left the plates where they were. He came back to the table, sat down, and started talking to me. I listened and ate and waited the requisite forty-five minutes for the drugs to take effect.

Many people are unsure how to comfort a friend or loved-one in times of loss. This special book is filled with inspirational wisdom, practical self-help for healing, and makes a meaningful and comforting gift.</p><p>Written by psychotherapist and grief expert Alexandra Kennedy, <em>Honoring Grief </em>provides powerful and compassionate advice for dealing with loss. Compatible with any religious or spiritual orientation, this book aims to help readers create a sanctuary&#x2015;a special space where they are free to work through the difficult emotions that accompany grief.</p><p>The act of grieving can be overwhelming. That&#x2019;s why the self-help tips in this book are simple, brief, and effective&#x2015;ideal for anyone suffering the emotionally and physically exhausting effects of grief.</p></p><p><strong>Alexandra Kennedy, MA, LMFT</strong>, is a psychotherapist in private practice thirty-nine years and author of <em>Losing a Parent</em>; <em>The Infinite Thread: Healing Relationships Beyond Loss</em>; and <em>How Did I Miss All This Before? Waking Up to the Magic of Our Ordinary Lives</em>. She is an adjunct faculty member of John F. Kennedy University and has taught at the University of California Santa Cruz Extension and the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology. She has been interviewed in <em>USA Today</em>, the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, the<em> San Francisco Examiner</em>, and the <em>Boston Herald, </em>as well as on NPR's <em>Talk of the Nation</em>, CNN's <em>Sonja Live</em>, and on KQED's <em>Family Talk </em>and <em>New Dimensions Radio</em>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Foreword writer <strong>Stephen Levine</strong> is an American poet, author, and teacher, who along with his wife and spiritual partner Ondrea Levine, is best known for his work on death and dying. He is the author of <em>Who Dies, Healing into Life and Death</em>,<em> Turning Toward the Mystery</em>, <em>Becoming Kuan Yin</em>, and many other books.&#x201c;This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gentle, quiet book.&nbsp;Alexandra&nbsp;Kennedy&nbsp;has traveled these pathways; authentic, genuine, heart-shredding grief is a fiercely intimate, intensely private matter, experienced in vastly unpredictable ways. We are thrust against our will into some brand new world, unique for each and every one of us.&nbsp;While she offers gentle suggestions, simple tools, and practices along the way,&nbsp;Kennedy&nbsp;wisely counsels there is&nbsp;&#x2018;no map, no schedule.&#x2019;&nbsp;There is tremendous mercy here. We are too often rushed through what must be allowed its time, its season, to ripen, to die, to heal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Kennedy&nbsp;is wise and compassionate, and she refuses to desecrate this holy mystery of loss. Rather, she offers simply to accompany us as we walk a path only we can follow. Kennedy teaches us to trust that Death knows the way to lead us into Life. For us, we can trust that Kennedy knows of what she speaks.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;</strong><strong>Wayne Muller</strong>, author of <em>Sabbath</em> and <em>A Life of Being, Having, and Doing Enough</em><br><br>&#x201c;A true&nbsp;pioneer in our&nbsp;field, Alexandra Kennedy offers a profoundly clear understanding of what it truly means to heal after a loss&nbsp;in her elegantly simple new book,&nbsp;<em>Honoring Grief.</em>&nbsp;It&#x2019;s sure to become a classic. For years to come,&nbsp;I'll be sharing this wonderful book&nbsp;with clients, families,&nbsp;friends, and&nbsp;communities&nbsp;besieged by loss.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ken Druck, PhD</strong>,&nbsp;grief and resilience coach and author of&nbsp;<em>The Real Rules of Life: Balancing Life's Terms with Your Own</em><br><br>&#x201c;If there is one person I&#x2019;d like to talk to after a loss, it is Alexandra Kennedy. She offers no platitudes for grief&#x2015;no one-size-fits-all recipe&#x2015;just wisdom, kindness, and empathy. Most of all, Kennedy tells us what we all need to hear: we are not alone, and, no, we are not going crazy.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Lolly Winston, MFA</strong>, author of the novels <em>Good Grief</em> and <em>Happiness Sold Separately</em><br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t usually think of grief as a healing journey; in fact, most of us would rather not think of grief at all. But Alexandra Kennedy gently, expertly guides the reader into a depth that is neither frightening nor overwhelming, but manageable and critical to one&#x2019;s true well-being. In <em>Honoring Grief</em>, she has distilled a lifetime of listening and examining to bring forth a sacred practice that allows us to meet grief where we are, be embraced in sanctuary, heal wounds, and renew life with new eyes and a more open heart. With this book&#x2019;s practices, grief can be a time to break free from the pain of long-held sufferings, and expand our capacity to love and live fully.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Beth Witrogen</strong>, Pulitzer Prize nominee and author of <em>Caregiving: The Spiritual Journey of Love, Loss, and Renewal </em><br><br>&#x201c;Grief is the way that loss heals. In <em>Honoring Grief, </em>Alexandra Kennedy offers us a sanctuary in which to process our losses and find healing. This simple-to-use, step-by-step workbook on the healing of grief can be a nightlight for people in dark times.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;Rachel Naomi Remen, MD</strong>, author of <em>Kitchen Table Wisdom</em> and <em>My Grandfather&#x2019;s Blessings</em><br><br>&#x201c;I loved this book. <em>Honoring Grief</em> provides safety, comfort, and guidance for healing after loss. The format makes it easily accessible to someone experiencing deep chaotic emotions. The&nbsp;text is poetic and beautifully crafted. I would recommend this book to my colleagues and friends. It will become part of my teaching.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2015;</strong><strong>Janet M.

Fueled by Wilson's own passionate engagement with the ideas and politics at play, it is a lively and vivid, sweeping account of a singular idea&#x2015;that it is possible to construct a society based on justice, equality, and freedom&#x2015;gaining the power to change history. </p><p>Vico, Michelet, Bakunin, and especially Marx&#x2015;along with scores of other anarchists, socialists, nihilists, utopians, and more&#x2015;all come to life in these pages. And in Wilson's telling, their stories and their ideas remain as alive, as provocative, as relevant now as they were in their own time.</p></p><p><b>Edmund Wilson</b> (1895&#x2013;1972) was among the foremost American men of letters of the twentieth century.

As he works to uncover clues about the turning point this seemingly idyllic territory will soon face, all he can determine is that the people of Ibara are blissfully happy. It's not long before Bobby discovers, however, that they are also blissfully...oblivious. <br> <br> The leaders of Ibara are keeping a devastating secret from their people, one that gives Saint Dane all the opportunity he needs to launch his final assault on Halla. <br> <br> While Bobby struggles to learn the truth in time to thwart Saint Dane, Courtney Chetwynde desperately searches for Mark Diamond. On the heels of a shocking tragedy, Mark has disappeared. Worse, he seems to be under Saint Dane's influence.

The eighth book in the riveting series brings Bobby to the territory of Ibara, a seemingly peaceful agrarian land. Bobby joins forces with the Jakills, a group of children who resist the obliviousness of their elders to try to stop the villain Saint Dane from bringing down Ibara.

Fully a third of us grew up in homes where our sexual development was terribly derailed, due to alcoholism or drug abuse, mental illness, witnessing spousal abuse, experiencing physical, emotional or sexual abuse, or just plain neglect. For others of us, the family problems were so subtle we never recognized them.<p> <i>Sex Smart</i> is the award-winning book praised by America's top sexologists as an essential guide for understanding your sexual self and solving your problems. </p><p> ''<i>Sex Smart</i> is a wonderfully written, clear account of the many factors that shape and influence our sexual selves. Unlike most self-help books, which focus on aspects of sexual performance, Dr. Zoldbrod takes a broad, integrative view. With great skill and warmth, she weaves a tapestry of complex non-sexual events in our past that determine the ways in which we relate sexually. Complemented by rich clinical vignettes, her book will be welcomed by those wishing to understand the nuances and mysteries that contribute to our sexual being.''<br> --Derek C.

The fire was not much bigger than a candle flame, and the fairies huddled close to it. <br> Normally, the fairies&#x2019; own golden glows would have brightened the night. But their glows were now faint. The flames provided the only light, which flickered across their worried faces. <br> Shadows, cast by the fire, played across a rock behind them. If the fairies had been paying attention, they would have noticed something strange. Although there were four of them, five shadows conferred on the rock. One in particular seemed alert. It tilted its pert head toward the campfire, as if trying to hear better. <br> But the fairies didn&#x2019;t notice. They were deep in conversation. <br> &#x201c;What can it mean?&#x201d; the garden-talent fairy Rosetta whispered. She wore a leaf around her shoulders like a shawl to keep warm. As she spoke, she pulled it tighter. &#x201c;Why would Tink write her name on this rock?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a message,&#x201d; the light-talent fairy Iridessa replied. &#x201c;The question is, who is it for?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s for the sprites in the Dark Forest,&#x201d; the animal-talent fairy Fawn said. &#x201c;They found her shoe, after all. Maybe she was trying to get it back.&#x201d; She patted the small leaf-satchel that held Tink&#x2019;s pompom slipper. The sprites had given it to them in exchange for their help bringing light to their village. <br> &#x201c;But the sprites never met Tink,&#x201d; Rosetta pointed out. &#x201c;Besides, they never leave the forest. Why would she leave them a message here?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s a message to herself,&#x201d; said Silvermist, who sat back from the fire. She was a water-talent fairy and didn&#x2019;t like flames. &#x201c;The rock is near the Lost Coast. Tink might have put it there in case she got lost so she could find her way back.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;But if Tink was on the Lost Coast, wouldn&#x2019;t we have found her?&#x201d; Iridessa asked. &#x201c;We searched up and down that beach. We didn&#x2019;t see any trace of Tink or her boat.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; Silvermist leaned forward, lowering her voice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget what I saw there in the fog. It looked like Tink, but it wasn&#x2019;t. It was like . . . the <i>ghost</i> of Tink.&#x201d; She shivered. <br> The other fairies shivered, too, except Iridessa, who frowned. <br> &#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; she scolded Silvermist. The water fairy&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t scare everyone with silly superstitions,&#x201d; Iridessa said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you saw. But I&#x2019;m sure Tink is alive and well, somewhere on Shadow Island.&#x201d; <br> Iridessa gathered a ball of firelight, squeezing it thoughtfully as if it were putty. Golden light shone between her fingers. <br> &#x201c;You know what I think?&#x201d; she said at last. She released the ball of light. It hung in the air, then faded. &#x201c;I think she wrote that message for <i>us</i>. Tink wants someone to know she&#x2019;s here. She needs help.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;That may be,&#x201d; Rosetta said. &#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t assume anything. From now on, we have to make choices carefully. We have only the fairy dust left on our wings. When it&#x2019;s gone, our magic will be gone, too.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Rosetta&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Iridessa said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be harder from here on. Anyone who wants to quit, speak up now.&#x201d; <br> The fairies looked at one another across the fire. <br> &#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; said Fawn. <br> &#x201c;Me either,&#x201d; said Silvermist. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here until we find her,&#x201d; said Rosetta. <br> Iridessa nodded. That settled it. <br> &#x201c;But what about the girls?&#x201d; Silvermist asked. <br> They all turned to look at the four human girls&#x2014;Kate McCrady, Lainey Winters, and Mia and Gabby Vasquez&#x2014; asleep nearby. To the tiny fairies, their slumbering forms were like small mountain ranges. <br> As they watched, the smallest girl, Gabby, turned over in her sleep and sighed. The fairies sighed, too. <br> &#x201c;When our magic is gone, we won&#x2019;t be able to take care of them,&#x201d; Iridessa said. &#x201c;They ought to be at home with their families. They&#x2019;re only children, after all.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;If we knew the way to Never Land, we could send them back to Pixie Hollow,&#x201d; Rosetta said. &#x201c;From there they could find their way home.&#x201d; <br> The other fairies nodded in agreement. Whatever happened, they needed to make sure the girls got home safely. <br> &#x201c;We should sleep,&#x201d; Iridessa said. &#x201c;Silvermist, will you put out the fire?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Gladly,&#x201d; replied the water fairy. She plucked a few dewdrops, cradling them in her arms. When her arms were full, she threw the droplets on the fire. The flame sizzled out. <br> Silvermist sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss doing that when my magic&#x2019;s gone. Fawn, what is it?&#x201d; <br> The animal fairy was staring at the side of the rock. &#x201c;I thought I saw&#x2014;&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;Never mind. My eyes were playing tricks on me. Let&#x2019;s get some sleep.&#x201d; <br> * <br> Lainey lay awake in the darkness long after the fairies had gone to sleep. She had heard everything they said. <br> Lainey, her friends, and the fairies had been on Shadow Island for days, searching for Tinker Bell. Lainey had never doubted that they&#x2019;d find her. She believed in the fairies with all her heart. If they worked together, they could do anything. <br> But now she realized the fairies didn&#x2019;t see it that way. Lainey and her friends were a burden! Iridessa&#x2019;s words echoed in Lainey&#x2019;s mind. <i>When our magic is gone, we won&#x2019;t be able to take care of them</i>. <br> Lainey sighed. The fairies were in trouble. If only there was something she could do to help them in return. But she had no magic. No special talents. What could she do? <br> She turned onto her back. Without her glasses, the stars were only distant blurs. Lainey picked out a silvery smudge and made a wish. She wished for what she always wished for. She wished for magic. <br> But as she closed her eyes to sleep, Lainey knew that she&#x2019;d made the wrong wish. This time, they needed more than magic. <br> They were going to need a miracle.</p><h2>Salad for Dinner: Complete Meals for All Seasons</h2><p>A celebration of contrasts in color, flavor, and texture&#x2014;an artfully prepared salad is one of the most appealing dishes to eat, engaging all the senses. It is a basic culinary fact but often overlooked: a salad packs the most flavor because the dressing coats every bite. And with the right combination, a salad can be a full meal in itself.&nbsp;<br><br>We all know it is healthier to eat more vegetables and whole grains. But how do you do so on a daily basis? This book reframes the question: Why not make greens the foundation of the plate? Smart, imaginative ideas abound: kale with lemon, parmesan, and almonds; Indonesian chicken salad with pineapple slaw; and salmon with quinoa, sorrel, and yogurt. There are super-hearty salads to satisfy even the biggest appetites, such as Korean barbecue beef salad; duck confit with fingerlings and frisee; and buttermilk fried chicken salad.

They would have struck up lively conversations, attempting to persuade their colleagues to accept one proposal or another, their animated faces reflecting off the room&#x2019;s varnished chestnut paneling. But tonight, pulled away from their evening activities, they wore sports slacks and shirts, their hair wet and windblown, their faces grim as they sat quietly in their seats, eyes fixed on the man at the head of the U-shaped conference table. <br>Beads of rain clung to Levi Rosenfeld&#x2019;s Windbreaker, left there by a spring storm that had settled over the Middle East, expending itself in unbridled fury, sheets of rain descending in cascading torrents. Prime Minister Rosenfeld, flanked by all twelve members of Israel&#x2019;s National Security Council, fumed silently in his seat as he awaited details of an unprecedented threat to his country&#x2019;s existence. He wondered how such critical information could have been discovered so late. At the far left of the conference table sat Barak Kogen, Israel&#x2019;s intelligence minister. Although Kogen was not a member of the Security Council, Rosenfeld had directed him to attend tonight&#x2019;s meeting to explain the Mossad&#x2019;s failure. <br>At the front of the room, a man stood before a large flat-screen monitor. Thin and short, wearing round wire-rimmed glasses, Ehud Rabin&#x2019;s physical presence failed to reflect the power he wielded as the leader of Israel&#x2019;s second-strongest political party and as Israel&#x2019;s defense minister. Ehud waited for Rosenfeld&#x2019;s permission to begin. <br>Rosenfeld nodded in his direction. <br>Pushing his glasses onto the bridge of his nose, Ehud stated what everyone in the room already knew. &#x201c;The Mossad reports Iran will complete assembly of its first nuclear weapon in ten days.&#x201d; The lights in the conference room flickered, thunder rumbling in the distance as if on cue. <br>Rosenfeld looked at his intelligence minister. &#x201c;Why did we discover this just now, only days before they complete assembly?&#x201d; <br>Kogen shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his eyes scanning each member of the Security Council before coming to rest on Rosenfeld. &#x201c;I apologize, Prime Minister. Nothing is more important than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But Iran has deceived us and the rest of the world. We were fortunate to discover the true extent of their progress in time. We will be more vigilant in the future.&#x201d; <br>There was something about Kogen&#x2019;s quick apology rather than stout defense of his Mossad that gave Rosenfeld the impression he was hiding something. But perhaps the evening&#x2019;s tension was clouding his intuition. He turned back to Ehud. &#x201c;What are our options?&#x201d; <br>Ehud pressed a remote control in his hand, stepping aside as the monitor flickered to life, displaying a map of Iran. &#x201c;Weapon assembly is occurring at the Natanz nuclear complex.&#x201d; A flashing red circle appeared two hundred kilometers south of Tehran. &#x201c;Uranium for additional weapons is being enriched at Isfahan, and plutonium is being produced at their heavy-water plant near Arak.&#x201d; Two more red circles appeared in central Iran. &#x201c;Eliminating the facilities at Arak and Isfahan will be easy, but destruction of their weapon assembly complex at Natanz will be impossible with a conventional strike.&#x201d; The map zoomed in on the Natanz facility, a sprawling collection of innocuous-looking buildings. &#x201c;Iran has built a hardened complex beneath the Karkas mountains, connected to the main facility by tunnels. While a conventional strike will collapse the tunnels, it cannot destroy the weapon assembly complex.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So how do we destroy this facility?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Since the complex cannot be destroyed with conventional weapons, that leaves one option.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld leaned forward in his chair. &#x201c;What are you proposing?&#x201d; <br>Ehud glared at the prime minister. &#x201c;You know exactly what needs to be done here, Levi. We have a responsibility to protect the citizens of our country. There is no question this weapon will be used against us, either directly or indirectly. We <i>must</i> destroy this facility before Iran completes assembly of this bomb, even if that means we have to employ one of <i>our</i> nuclear weapons.&#x201d; <br>The conference room erupted. Some council members passionately agreed with Ehud while others chastised him for proposing such an egregious break in policy. Rosenfeld slammed his fist on the table, silencing the room. &#x201c;Out of the question! We will not use nuclear weapons unless they are used against us first.&#x201d; <br>Ehud&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Then millions of our people will die, because Iran <i>will</i> use this weapon against us. We can either strike now, before our men, women, and children are murdered, or afterward. If we do not strike first, their deaths will be on your conscience.&#x201d; <br>The defense minister&#x2019;s assertion hung in the air as Rosenfeld surveyed his council members, some of them staring back, others with their eyes to the table. Whether they agreed with Ehud or not, they could not avoid the underlying truth. <br>If Iran assembled this weapon, it would eventually be used against Israel. That was something Israel could not allow. But a nuclear first strike! Although the prime minister and his Security Council had the authority to authorize the use of nuclear weapons, morally&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Rosenfeld looked down one side of the conference table and then the other, examining the faces of the men and women seated around him, eventually returning his attention to Ehud. &#x201c;Are there are no conventional weapons capable of destroying this complex? Not even in the American arsenal?&#x201d; <br>Ehud&#x2019;s lips drew thin. &#x201c;The Americans have the necessary weapons. But they will not provide them to us while they engage in <i>discussions</i> with Iran.&#x201d; Ehud&#x2019;s voice dripped with disdain as he mentioned America&#x2019;s attempt to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions with mere words. <br>&#x201c;Do not discount our ally so easily,&#x201d; Rosenfeld replied. &#x201c;I will meet with the American ambassador tomorrow and explain the situation.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You are blind, Levi.&#x201d; Ehud&#x2019;s face tightened. &#x201c;The Americans have abandoned us, and you fail to recognize it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, Ehud! Provide me with the information on the weapons we need, and I will broach this with the United States.&#x201d; <br>Ehud nodded tersely. <br>Rosenfeld stood. &#x201c;Unless there is more to discuss, I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow morning.&#x201d; <br>The council members filed out of the conference room, until only Rosenfeld and Kogen remained. <br>Turning to Rosenfeld, Kogen said, &#x201c;Prime Minister, may I have a word with you, privately?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course. What would you like to discuss?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s best we not talk here.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Footsteps echoed off the gray terrazzo floor as the two men, each lost in his own thoughts, walked down the Hall of Advisers toward Rosenfeld&#x2019;s office. On their right, paintings of Israel&#x2019;s prime ministers hung in shallow alcoves, beginning with the image of their country&#x2019;s first premier, David Ben-Gurion, who guided Israel through its War of Independence. At the far end of the hallway, a conspicuous bare spot on the wall marked the location where Rosenfeld&#x2019;s portrait would someday hang. <br>Glancing at the shorter and heavier man walking beside him, Kogen thought Rosenfeld had aged more than could be attributed to the normal passage of time. But that was easily explained. Shortly after his election six years ago, the prime minister had weathered a three-year intifada. Then there was the personal loss he had endured, compounded by his dual responsibilities as father and prime minister. Yet despite the toll of his years in office, the older man walked with a determined pace and slightly forward lean, as if barreling through unseen obstacles in his path. The brisk pace was his only exercise; workouts were always something to be scheduled in the not too distant future. As a result, he had steadily added padding to his midsection. But Kogen knew Rosenfeld considered his weight acceptable as long as the circumference of his waist remained smaller than the width of his shoulders. Fortunately, Rosenfeld had broad shoulders. <br>Kogen, on the other hand, had retained his youthful physique, lean and muscular. The taller man, always impeccably dressed, he projected an air of competence and confidence. To the uninformed, Kogen was the more ideal image of a prime minister. But his service had been limited to the military and Israel&#x2019;s intelligence service; he&#x2019;d been appointed intelligence minister shortly after Rosenfeld&#x2019;s election as prime minister. <br>Reaching the end of the hallway, Rosenfeld and Kogen passed through a metal detector and into the Aquarium, the security guard&#x2019;s eyes displaying no hint of curiosity about their arrival so late on a Monday evening. The Aquarium section of the PMO, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Office building, where foreign leaders visited their Israeli counterparts, contained a plush, well-appointed lobby, offices for Rosenfeld and his closest aides, and a communications center that allowed for minute-by-minute contact with the Israel Defense Forces. Kogen reflected on the many decisions Rosenfeld and previous prime ministers had made in that small room, guiding Israel through its turbulent history; decisions that paled in importance to the one that would be made tonight. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Following the prime minister into his office, Kogen sat stiffly in the chair across from Rosenfeld&#x2019;s desk, scanning the content of the modestly furnished room as he collected his thoughts. The furniture was spartan and utilitarian, the desk and chairs made from natural unstained maple, unadorned with intricate carvings. The shelf behind Rosenfeld was filled with books arranged in no particular order. The office, with its indecipherable filing system and simple furnishings, reflected the prime minister perfectly&#x2014;it was difficult to gauge his reaction to complex issues, yet straightforward once a decision was made. Although Kogen had known Rosenfeld his entire adult life, he could not predict his friend&#x2019;s response. Rosenfeld&#x2019;s decision would determine whether four years of painstaking preparation had been in vain. <br>Heavy drops of rain pelted the prime minister&#x2019;s windows as Rosenfeld waited for Kogen to speak. As impatience gathered in Rosenfeld&#x2019;s eyes, Kogen steeled himself. He cleared his throat, then began. &#x201c;We must destroy Natanz, Levi. You know better than anyone the sacrifice we will endure as a nation if Iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld glanced at the framed portrait of his family, still sitting on his desk. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not telling me anything I don&#x2019;t already know, Barak.&#x201d; <br>Lowering his voice, Kogen continued, &#x201c;Iran is a cesspool of contempt for Israel, intent on exterminating our people. Natanz <i>must</i> be destroyed before this weapon is assembled. We do not have the necessary conventional weapons. Therefore it must be destroyed with a nuclear strike.&#x201d; <br>There was a long silence as Rosenfeld contemplated Kogen&#x2019;s assertion. Finally, Rosenfeld spoke. &#x201c;I will not authorize the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. From a political and moral standpoint, that is something we cannot do.&#x201d; <br>Kogen leaned back in his chair, a sly smile emerging on his lips. &#x201c;I never said <i>Israel</i> would launch the nuclear strike.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld blinked, not comprehending Kogen&#x2019;s statement. &#x201c;Then who?&#x201d; <br>The younger man&#x2019;s smile widened. &#x201c;America.&#x201d; <br>A puzzled expression worked its way across Rosenfeld&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;America? The president would never authorize this.&#x201d; <br>Kogen hesitated a moment before continuing. It was finally time to reveal the Mossad&#x2019;s most closely held secret. &#x201c;The president&#x2019;s authorization isn&#x2019;t required, Prime Minister. Only yours. The Mossad stands ready to initiate an operation that will result in America destroying Natanz. Your authorization is the only step remaining.&#x201d; <br>Rosenfeld stared at Kogen for a long moment, then his eyes went to the portrait of his family again. No one understood better what was at stake than Rosenfeld, and Kogen knew he was struggling. Iran didn&#x2019;t have an army massed on Israel&#x2019;s border. They didn&#x2019;t have a nuclear arsenal in the process of being launched. Yet the threat Iran posed was severe. It had to be dealt with, and deceiving America into employing one of its nuclear weapons was the perfect solution. <br>It didn&#x2019;t take long for Rosenfeld to come to a decision. <br>&#x201c;Absolutely not!&#x201d; <br>Frustration boiled inside Kogen. Still, he harbored hope Rosenfeld would eventually come to the proper decision. The Mossad plan was a radical proposal, and the prime minister would need time to accept it. After a few days of reflection, Rosenfeld would see the wisdom in Kogen&#x2019;s solution. <br>Showing no outward sign of his frustration, Kogen stood. Before turning to leave, he said, &#x201c;In ten days, Prime Minister, Iran will complete assembly of this weapon. You have until then to decide.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Rick Campbell <br></p><h2>The Double Bind (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p>From the bestselling author of <i>The Flight Attendant</i>, here is a gripping&nbsp;psychological novel of obsession and consequence.<br><br>When Laurel Estabrook is attacked while riding her bicycle through Vermont&#x2019;s back roads, her life is forever changed. Formerly outgoing, Laurel withdraws into her photography, spending all her free time at a homeless shelter. There she meets Bobbie Crocker, a man with a history of mental illness and a box of photographs that he won&#x2019;t let anyone see. When Bobbie dies, Laurel discovers a deeply hidden secret&#x2013;a story that leads her far from her old life, and into a cat-and-mouse game with pursuers who claim they want to save her.<p>In a tale that travels between the Roaring Twenties and the twenty-first century, between Jay Gatsby&#x2019;s Long Island and rural New England, bestselling author Chris Bohjalian has written an extraordinary novel.</p></p><p>Best known for the provocative and powerful novel, <i>Midwives</i> (an Oprah Book Club� Selection), Chris Bohjalian writes beautiful and riveting fiction featuring what the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> dubbed "ordinary people in heartbreaking circumstances behaving with grace and dignity." In his new novel, <i>The Double Bind</i>, a literary thriller with references to (and including characters from) <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Bohjalian takes readers on a haunting journey through one woman's obsession with uncovering a dark secret. We think Bohjalian fans will be thrilled with this compelling and unforgettable read, but just to be sure, we asked bestselling author Jodi Picoult to read <i>The Double Bind</i> and give us her take. Check out her review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Jodi Picoult</strong><br><br><b> From the provocative and gut-wrenching <i>The Pact</i>, to the brilliant genre-bending <i>The Tenth Circle</i>, to her latest novel about a high school shooting <i>Nineteen Minutes</i>, Jodi Picoult's riveting novels center on family and relationships, and bring to light questions and issues that remain with a reader long after the last page is turned.</b> <br><br> I once heard a fellow novelist call writing "successful schizophrenia"--we invent people and worlds that don't exist; but instead of being medicated, we are paid for it. Although countless novels succeed in whisking the reader away on the heels of such fabrications, there are very few that pull the curtain away from the craft, allowing us inside the mind of a working novelist as he combines reality and fantasy. Chris Bohjalian's <i>The Double Bind</i> is not just one of these; it's the finest example I've ever read of a book that tips its hat to both the beauty of the literary creation, as well as the magical act of creating.<p> Fact and fiction become indistinguishable in <i>The Double Bind</i>: The story centers on Laurel Estabrook, a young social worker and survivor of a near-rape, who stumbles across photographs taken by a formerly homeless client and tries to understand how a man who'd taken snapshots of celebrities in the 50s and 60s might have wound up on the streets. However, an author's note tells us that Bohjalian conceived this book after being shown a batch of old photographs taken by a once-homeless man; and the actual photos of Bob "Soupy" Campbell are peppered throughout the text. In another neat twist, Bohjalian's resurrects details from <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, which become "real" in the context of his own novel--Laurel lives in West Egg; part of her hunt for her photographer's past involves meeting with the descendants of Daisy and Tom Buchanan.</p><p> As a writer who counts <i>The Great Gatsby</i> as one of the books that changed her life, this inclusion was both startling and remarkable for me. Who doesn't want one's favorite characters to come to life--even if it's only within the constraints of another fictional work? But Bohjalian chose his text wisely: no discussion of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is complete without alluding to missed opportunities and unreliable sources--critical elements in Laurel's quest. And therein lies Bohjalian's true double bind: all stories--even the ones we tell ourselves--are subject to our own interpretation, and to the degree we can make others believe them.</p><p> <i>The Double Bind</i> may flirt with the classics, but it's not your father's stuffy old tome: it's the sort of book you want to read in one sitting, and it packs a twist at the end that will leave you speechless. It also, worthily, spotlights the cause of homelessness in a way that isn't preachy, but honest and explanatory. Ultimately, what Bohjalian's done is offer his lucky readers another reminder of why he's such an extraordinary author: by creating characters that become so real we lose the distinction between truth and embellishment; by reminding us that the story of any life--whether fictional, functional, or marginal--is one to be savored. <i>--Jodi Picoult</i><br> </p><br><p>CHRIS BOHJALIAN is the author of twenty books, including&nbsp;<i>The Guest Room; Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands; The Sandcastle Girls; Skeletons at the Feast; The Double Bind;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Midwives&nbsp;</i>which was a number one&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller and a selection of Oprah's Book Club.

See his work at KeithThompsonArt.com.Gr 5-9-After vanquishing one of four powerful witch sisters who control the world's essential elements in Mistress of the Storm (Random, 2011), Verity Gallant and her friends have enjoyed an idyllic summer in their cliffside hometown of Wellow. Strange events soon shatter the peace, however: the earth is eroding away beneath their feet, causing hazardous conditions, and insidious white sand suddenly seems to be covering everything. It soon becomes apparent that these are the machinations of the Earth Witch, turned to stone and smashed into millions of pieces long ago by the cruel-hearted Wind Witch, and now determined to re-form into a vengeful whole and wipe out every "happy-ever-after" along the way. Relying once again upon hard work (including library research and brilliant code-cracking), danger-fraught investigations, and hard-earned insights, Verity and her compatriots must put together the pieces of a twist-turning mystery and try to stop this formidable new enemy. Built upon a bulwark of intricately wrought backstory and mythology, this satisfying fantasy combines fast-paced adventure with slow-brewing suspense that is both spine-tingling and delightfully unsettling. The characters are multidimensional, with heroes who experience moments of jealousy or selfishness, and villains capable of remorse. Enhanced by funny banter and believable emotions, Verity's relationships with her peers-including a budding romance-are deftly drawn, as are her own insecurities and revelations. Reading the first book first is not necessary, but those who have will better appreciate this well-written and richly imagined offering.-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal&#x3b1;|9781416971795|9781442454125WESTERFELD, Scott.

LC 2011038924. ~Gr 7 Up-Fans of Westerfeld's "Leviathan" books (S &amp; S) will already be familiar with the steampunk story that blends history with fantasy, as well as with Thompson's amazing illustrations. The series begins in an alternate 1914 Europe, in which 15-year-old prince Alek (son of Archduke Franz Ferdinand) plays a key role in the war between the Clankers and the Darwinists. The Clankers use mechanized objects to do battle, and the Darwinists use genetically engineered beasts. The story takes place in a world in which objects that readers would usually expect to be inanimate, like ships, weapons, and even maps, are often living creatures. While the novels are mostly filled with Westerfeld's narratives, interspersed with Thompson's occasional black-and-white illustrations, Aeronautics puts Thompson's artwork front and center, now in full color. Fans of the series will appreciate the intricately detailed pictures of the airship Leviathan, as well as beasts of all shapes and sizes, uniforms, weapons, vehicles, and people. This volume might also serve as a gateway for curious readers into the novels, or even to the history books so they can learn about what really happened during The Great War.-Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Volume 2, &#34;The Cover-Up Exposed, 1973-1991,&#34; analyzes the UFO sightings, politics, and research that occurred during the last two decades of the cold war. Working from archival sources, professional journals, and his own investigations, Dolan describes UFO encounters worldwide, demonstrating that the phenomenon is global, and the result of advanced technology. Many cases involved sensitive military airspace. These include intrusions over U.S. air bases; attempts to intercept a UFO over Tehran; the landing of an unknown object near two airbases in Britain; large boomerang-shaped craft near New York City; unexplained triangular craft seen throughout the U.S. and Europe; strange objects in Earth orbit seen by Soviet and American astronauts; and encounters with UFOs from around the world. Dolan also studies &#34;UFO politics,&#34; describes the black-budget connection, and provides a geopolitical analysis to explain the whys and hows of UFO secrecy. Finally, he provides a history of UFO research. He recreates the discussions and debates concerning alien abductions, animal mutilations, intelligence community infiltration into UFO research, the controversial MJ-12 documents, the Gulf Breeze controversy, reverse engineering of alien technology, crop circles, and more. Dolan also studies the effect of such new technologies as the Internet on UFO research. This is a complete history of the phenomenon, the secrecy, and the response by researchers who sought to understand the mystery. Behind it all is the backdrop of a world in technological, economic, and political transformation. This book takes the reader through a turning point in the history of the UFO phenomenon, as well as the history of the modern world.

Derailed in the 1970s by mental illness, drug use, and the shifting fortunes of the band, Wilson came back again and again over the next few decades, surviving and--finally--thriving.

So it should come as no wonder that in the 1960s Charles Addams was dabbling with a "cookbook" idea. Addams discovered and compiled some bizarre recipes from antiquated and out-of-the-way sources. These recipes have very Addams-like names, such as "Mushrooms Fester" or "Hearts Stuffed," and serve as a perfect complement to his drawings. <br> <br><i>Chas Addams&#x2122; Half-Baked Cookbook</i> is a collection of his work on the world of food and eating, featuring many Addams drawings that have never been seen before, as well as some of his all-time classics.</p><p><b>Chas Addams</b> was the creator of the "Addams Family" cartoons, which first appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i> and were the inspiration for the popular <i>The Addams Family</i> television show and movies. He has been honored with the Yale Humor Award (1954) and a Special Edgar Award for "Cartoonist of the Macabre" from the Mystery Writers of America. Addams died in 1988 in New York City.Legendary <i>New Yorker </i>cartoonist and master of the macabre Addams has clawed his way back from the sepulcher with this odd fusion of posthumously unearthed and unpublished cartoons and a cookbook liberally seasoned with the distinctive flavor of Addams's signature gallows wit. Most of the cartoons on display here are clearly late period Addams and, to be fair, appear to have been rescued from his slush pile. Sketchy, incomplete and in some cases difficult to read, the unpublished cartoons are still worth a look since even mediocre Addams is better than no Addams at all. The recipes, on the other hand, are a truly bizarre assortment, featuring such epicurean delights as macaroni and oysters, dandelion beer, stewed pigeons, potted woodland squirrel, stuffed hearts, reindeer rice curry, the children's curative "influenza punch" and the intriguing "transparent pie." The more visceral ingredients have been thoughtfully supplied with conventionally acquired substitutes if preferred and could prove a fun challenge to the adventurous kitchen witch. Despite its shortcomings, this volume is a welcome addition to the bookshelf of any Addams fan and an eyebrow-raising sight when spotted among an assortment of cooking tomes. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the common struggle for those of us walking through the Land of Unanswered Prayer. Life doesn&#x2019;t look the way we expected, so we seek to protect ourselves from further disappointment.<br><br>But God has a third path for us, beyond sadness or resignation: the way of aching joy. Christ himself is with us here, beckoning us toward the treasures hidden in the darkness.<br><br><i>Aching Joy</i> is an honest psalm of hope for those walking between pain and promise: the aching of a broken world and the beauty of a loving God. In this place, rather than trying to dodge the pain, we choose to feel it all&#x2015;and to see where Jesus is in the midst of struggle. And because we make that choice, we feel all the good that comes with it, too.<br><br>This is Jason&#x2019;s story. This is your story. Come, find your joy within the aching.</p><p>Sometimes we beg God for an answer to prayer and don&#x2019;t receive it. Then what? Hague writes with raw honesty about his son&#x2019;s autism diagnosis&#x2015;and the prayer requests denied. I don&#x2019;t know the source of your begging (mine was different from Hague&#x2019;s), but you&#x2019;ll grow through the universal wisdom found in this book, which helps readers see that God is still in the story&#x2015;and that our circumstances don&#x2019;t get to decide our levels of joy. A new kind of joy&#x2015;an aching joy&#x2015;awaits. (September Vaudrey, author of Colors of Goodbye)<br><br>The best memoirs tell a story that is specific and individual and yet somehow transcends particularity. <i>Aching Joy</i> tells a story of one man&#x2019;s pain and growth in the years following his son&#x2019;s diagnosis with autism, and at the same time, this book invites me into reflection about my own experience with pain, denial, hope, and healing. As this father begins to let go of fear and open his heart up to trust, I, too, am invited to explore all the ways I have shut myself off from the ache, and the joy, of full life. (Amy Julia Becker, author of White Picket Fences)<br><br>Honest, wise, beautiful. After I lost a dear friend, <i>Aching Joy</i> was precisely what I needed to read. Jason Hague&#x2019;s honesty about his own failings, doubts, and questions about God in a painful season of his family&#x2019;s life made me feel like I wasn&#x2019;t alone. His insights, wisdom, and sensitivity to God gave me hope. I cried multiple times reading this book. Highly recommended. (Matt Mikalatos, author of Good News for a Change and Sky Lantern)<br><br>Jason accomplishes the extraordinary: He teaches and shares wisdom without condescension. He preaches without being preachy. With honesty and humility, he shares the unvarnished, unfiltered challenges that confront every special-needs parent and the wisdom that is earned through facing those challenges with honest personal and spiritual reflection. His love for his family drips from every page, and the wisdom he shares translates to anyone facing a critical life challenge. This is an important book and an important message. I&#x2019;m honored to call him my friend. (Jerry Turning, JR. (Mr. Bacon), blogger at Bacon and Juice Boxes: Our Life with Autism)<br><br>Jason Hague is a modern-day psalmist. His words ring with courage, honesty, transparency, and raw beauty. He shines a light in the darkness to remind us that every single emotion is safe before a sovereign God who is big enough to hold all the pieces. (Tricia Lott Williford, author of And Life Comes Back and You Can Do This)<br><br>When followers of Jesus face devastating pain, unanswered prayer, and dashed hopes, Jason Hague says Western Christianity offers two options: a pious, naive, praise-the-Lord-anyway optimism or a realistic, resigned, <i>Where are you, God?</i> despair. Through the raw story of his relationship with his son Jack, who wrestles with autism, Hague offers another path: courageously walking alongside a relentlessly loving Father into a life of deep mystery&#x2015;the mystery of fully embracing both the hopeful, redemptive dreams of victory and the disappointment of unexplained, bleeding-out defeat. In other words, a mysterious, powerful life of . . . aching joy. (J. Kevin Butcher, author of Choose and Choose Again)<br><br>My family&#x2019;s story and Jason&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s story are very similar, but the themes of <i>Aching Joy</i> are universal. We all wonder what God is up to in times of hardship, especially when it seems to go on for years. Jason&#x2019;s transparency is a gift that shows us how to live with both joy and longing. His courage to share his experiences gives me courage to keep holding on to God as I raise my son, who has Level 3 autism. Following Jason&#x2019;s example, I can rejoice in my hopes, be patient in my trials, and persevere in my prayers, as the apostle Paul instructs us. (Sandra Peoples, MDiv, author of Unexpected Blessings)<br><br>Jason Hague&#x2019;s book, <i>Aching Joy</i>, is for anyone whose dreams have at one time turned to rubble in &#x201c;the Land of Unanswered Prayer,&#x201d; which is &#x201c;just east of Acceptance and west of Breakthrough.&#x201d; It is <i>also</i> for parents of children who have special needs (or their friends), or anyone who walks alongside families with a loved one on the autism spectrum. The struggles Hague&#x2019;s son experiences trying to express his inner world, as well as the turmoil Hague describes in his efforts to truly have a relationship with his son, ring with gritty honesty and give no easy answers. But there is beauty and redemption. As Hague moves through the graveyard of his hopes, while still believing&#x2015;or trying to believe&#x2015;in an almighty Father who can move mountains, he gains insights into &#x201c;incarnational parenting&#x201d; that are full of startling joy&#x2015;and hope&#x2015;for us all, whatever our journeys.

Now, for the first time, her best essays on the subject are gathered together in one concise volume. Whether she&#x2019;s calling for equal opportunity for American women (years before the founding of the National Organization for Women), championing a more discerning standard of beauty that goes beyond plastic surgery&#x2019;s quest for eternal youth, lauding the liberating force of rock and roll, or demanding free and unfettered speech on university campuses and beyond, Paglia can always be counted on to get to the heart of matters large and small. At once illuminating, witty, and inspiring, these essays are essential reading that affirm the power of men and women and what we can accomplish together.</p><p>Camille Paglia&nbsp;is the University Professor of Humanities and Media Studies at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. A regular contributor to Salon.com, she is the author of&nbsp;<i>Glittering Images</i>;&nbsp;<i>Break, Blow, Burn; Vamps &amp; Tramps</i>;&nbsp;<i>Sex, Art, and American Culture</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Sexual Personae.&nbsp;</i>1<br><br>Sex and Violence, or Nature and Art<br><br>In the beginning was nature. The background from which and against which our ideas of God were formed, nature remains the supreme moral problem. We cannot hope to understand sex and gender until we clarify our attitude toward nature. Sex is a subset to nature. Sex is the natural in man.<br><br>Society is an artificial construction, a defense against nature&#x2019;s power. Without society, we would be storm-tossed on the barbarous sea that is nature. Society is a system of inherited forms reducing our humiliating passivity to nature. We may alter these forms, slowly or suddenly, but no change in society will change nature. Human beings are not nature&#x2019;s favorites. We are merely one of a multitude of species upon which nature indiscriminately exerts its force. Nature has a master agenda we can only dimly know.<br><br>Human life began in flight and fear. Religion rose from rituals of propitiation, spells to lull the punishing elements. To this day, communities are few in regions scorched by heat or shackled by ice. Civilized man conceals from himself the extent of his subordination to nature. The grandeur of culture, the consolation of religion absorb his attention and win his faith. But let nature shrug, and all is in ruin. Fire, flood, lightning, tornado, hurricane, volcano, earthquake&#x2014;anywhere at any time. Disaster falls upon the good and bad. Civilized life requires a state of illusion. The idea of the ultimate benevolence of nature and God is the most potent of man&#x2019;s survival mechanisms. Without it, culture would revert to fear and despair.<br><br>Sexuality and eroticism are the intricate intersection of nature and culture. Feminists grossly oversimplify the problem of sex when they reduce it to a matter of social convention: readjust society, eliminate sexual inequality, purify sex roles, and happiness and harmony will reign. Here feminism, like all liberal movements of the past two hundred years, is heir to Rousseau. The Social Contract (1762) begins: &#x201c;Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.&#x201d; Pitting benign Romantic nature against corrupt society, Rousseau produced the progressivist strain in nineteenth-century culture, for which social reform was the means to achieve paradise on earth. The bubble of these hopes was burst by the catastrophes of two world wars. But Rousseauism was reborn in the postwar generation of the Sixties, from which contemporary feminism developed.<br><br>Rousseau rejects original sin, Christianity&#x2019;s pessimistic view of man born unclean, with a propensity for evil. Rousseau&#x2019;s idea, derived from Locke, of man&#x2019;s innate goodness led to social environmentalism, now the dominant ethic of American human services, penal codes, and behaviorist therapies. It assumes that aggression, violence, and crime come from social deprivation&#x2014;a poor neighborhood, a bad home. Thus feminism blames rape on pornography and, by a smug circularity of reasoning, interprets outbreaks of sadism as a backlash to itself. But rape and sadism have been evident throughout history and, at some moment, in all cultures.<br><br>This book takes the point of view of Sade, the most unread major writer in Western literature. Sade&#x2019;s work is a comprehensive satiric critique of Rousseau, written in the decade after the first failed Rousseauist experiment, the French Revolution, which ended not in political paradise but in the hell of the Reign of Terror. Sade follows Hobbes rather than Locke. Aggression comes from nature; it is what Nietzsche is to call the will-to-power. For Sade, getting back to nature (the Romantic imperative that still permeates our culture from sex counseling to cereal commercials) would be to give free rein to violence and lust. I agree. Society is not the criminal but the force which keeps crime in check. When social controls weaken, man&#x2019;s innate cruelty bursts forth. The rapist is created not by bad social influences but by a failure of social conditioning. Feminists, seeking to drive power relations out of sex, have set themselves against nature. Sex is power. Identity is power. In Western culture, there are no nonexploitative relationships. Everyone has killed in order to live. Nature&#x2019;s universal law of creation from destruction operates in mind as in matter. As Freud, Nietzsche&#x2019;s heir, asserts, identity is conflict. Each generation drives its plow over the bones of the dead.<br><br>Modern liberalism suffers unresolved contradictions. It exalts individualism and freedom and, on its radical wing, condemns social orders as oppressive. On the other hand, it expects government to provide materially for all, a feat manageable only by an expansion of authority and a swollen bureaucracy. In other words, liberalism defines government as tyrant father but demands it behave as nurturant mother. Feminism has inherited these contradictions. It sees every hierarchy as repressive, a social fiction; every negative about woman is a male lie designed to keep her in her place. Feminism has exceeded its proper mission of seeking political equality for women and has ended by rejecting contingency, that is, human limitation by nature or fate.<br><br>Sexual freedom, sexual liberation. A modern delusion. We are hierarchical animals. Sweep one hierarchy away, and another will take its place, perhaps less palatable than the first. There are hierarchies in nature and alternate hierarchies in society. In nature, brute force is often the law. In society, there are protections for the weak. Society is our frail barrier against nature. When the prestige of state and religion is low, men are free, but they find freedom intolerable and seek new ways to enslave themselves, through drugs or depression. My theory is that whenever sexual freedom is sought or achieved, sadomasochism will not be far behind. Romanticism always turns into decadence. Nature is a hard taskmaster. It is the hammer and the anvil, crushing individuality. Perfect freedom would be to die by earth, air, water, and fire.<br><br>Sex is a far darker power than feminism has admitted. Behaviorist sex therapies believe guiltless, no-fault sex is possible. But sex has always been girt round with taboo, irrespective of culture. Sex is the point of contact between man and nature, where morality and good intentions fall to primitive urges. I called it an intersection. This intersection is the uncanny crossroads of Hecate, where all things return in the night. Eroticism is a realm stalked by ghosts. It is the place beyond the pale, both cursed and enchanted.<br><br>This book shows how much in culture goes against our best wishes. Integration of man&#x2019;s body and mind is a profound problem that is not about to be solved by recreational sex or an expansion of women&#x2019;s civil rights. Incarnation, the limitation of mind by matter, is an outrage to imagination. Equally outrageous is gender, which we have not chosen but which nature has imposed upon us. Our physicality is torment, our body the tree of nature on which Blake sees us crucified.<br><br>Sex is daemonic. This term, current in Romantic studies of the past twenty-five years, derives from the Greek daimon, meaning a spirit of lower divinity than the Olympian gods (hence my pronunciation &#x201c;daimonic&#x201d;). The outcast Oedipus becomes a daemon at Colonus. The word came to mean a man&#x2019;s guardian shadow. Christianity turned the daemonic into the demonic. The Greek daemons were not evil&#x2014;or rather they were both good and evil, like nature itself, in which they dwelled. Freud&#x2019;s unconscious is a daemonic realm. In the day we are social creatures, but at night we descend to the dream world where nature reigns, where there is no law but sex, cruelty, and metamorphosis. Day itself is invaded by daemonic night. Moment by moment, night flickers in the imagination, in eroticism, subverting our strivings for virtue and order, giving an uncanny aura to objects and persons, revealed to us through the eyes of the artist.<br><br>The ghost-ridden character of sex is implicit in Freud&#x2019;s brilliant theory of &#x201c;family romance.&#x201d; We each have an incestuous constellation of sexual personae that we carry from childhood to the grave and that determines whom and how we love or hate. Every encounter with friend or foe, every clash with or submission to authority bears the perverse traces of family romance. Love is a crowded theater, for as Harold Bloom remarks, &#x201c;We can never embrace (sexually or otherwise) a single person, but embrace the whole of her or his family romance.&#x201d;1 We still know next to nothing of the mystery of cathexis, the investment of libido in certain people or things. The element of free will in sex and emotion is slight. As poets know, falling in love is irrational.<br><br>Like art, sex is fraught with symbols. Family romance means that adult sex is always representation, ritualistic acting out of vanished realities. A perfectly humane eroticism may be impossible. Somewhere in every family romance is hostility and aggression, the homicidal wishes of the unconscious. Children are monsters of unbridled egotism and will, for they spring directly from nature, hostile intimations of immorality. We carry that daemonic will within us forever. Most people conceal it with acquired ethical precepts and meet it only in their dreams, which they hastily forget upon waking. The will-to-power is innate, but the sexual scripts of family romance are learned. Human beings are the only creatures in whom consciousness is so entangled with animal instinct. In Western culture, there can never be a purely physical or anxiety-free sexual encounter. Every attraction, every pattern of touch, every orgasm is shaped by psychic shadows.<br><br>The search for freedom through sex is doomed to failure. In sex, compulsion and ancient Necessity rule. The sexual personae of family romance are obliterated by the tidal force of regression, the backwards movement toward primeval dissolution, which Ferenczi identifies with ocean. An orgasm is a domination, a surrender, or a breaking through. Nature is no respecter of human identity. This is why so many men turn away or flee after sex, for they have sensed the annihilation of the daemonic. Western love is a displacement of cosmic realities. It is a defense mechanism rationalizing forces ungoverned and ungovernable. Like early religion, it is a device enabling us to control our primal fear.<br><br>Sex cannot be understood because nature cannot be understood. Science is a method of logical analysis of nature&#x2019;s operations. It has lessened human anxiety about the cosmos by demonstrating the materiality of nature&#x2019;s forces, and their frequent predictability. But science is always playing catch-up ball. Nature breaks its own rules whenever it wants. Science cannot avert a single thunderbolt. Western science is a product of the Apollonian mind: its hope is that by naming and classification, by the cold light of intellect, archaic night can be pushed back and defeated.<br><br>Name and person are part of the West&#x2019;s quest for form. The West insists on the discrete identity of objects. To name is to know; to know is to control. I will demonstrate that the West&#x2019;s greatness arises from this delusional certitude. Far Eastern culture has never striven against nature in this way. Compliance, not confrontation is its rule. Buddhist meditation seeks the unity and harmony of reality. Twentieth-century physics, going full circle back to Heracleitus, postulates that all matter is in motion. In other words, there is no thing, only energy. But this perception has not been imaginatively absorbed, for it cancels the West&#x2019;s intellectual and moral assumptions.<br><br>The Westerner knows by seeing. Perceptual relations are at the heart of our culture, and they have produced our titanic contributions to art. Walking in nature, we see, identify, name, recognize. This recognition is our apotropaion, that is, our warding off of fear. Recognition is ritual cognition, a repetition-compulsion. We say that nature is beautiful. But this aesthetic judgment, which not all peoples have shared, is another defense formation, woefully inadequate for encompassing nature&#x2019;s totality. What is pretty in nature is confined to the thin skin of the globe upon which we huddle. Scratch that skin, and nature&#x2019;s daemonic ugliness will erupt.<br><br>Our focus on the pretty is an Apollonian strategy. The leaves and flowers, the birds, the hills are a patchwork pattern by which we map the known. What the West represses in its view of nature is the chthonian, which means &#x201c;of the earth&#x201d;&#x2014;but earth&#x2019;s bowels, not its surface. Jane Harrison uses the term for pre-Olympian Greek religion, and I adopt it as a substitute for Dionysian, which has become contaminated with vulgar pleasantries. The Dionysian is no picnic. It is the chthonian realities which Apollo evades, the blind grinding of subterranean force, the long slow suck, the murk and ooze. It is the dehumanizing brutality of biology and geology, the Darwinian waste and bloodshed, the squalor and rot we must block from consciousness to retain our Apollonian integrity as persons. Western science and aesthetics are attempts to revise this horror into imaginatively palatable form.<br><br>The daemonism of chthonian nature is the West&#x2019;s dirty secret. Modern humanists made the &#x201c;tragic sense of life&#x201d; the touchstone of mature understanding. They defined man&#x2019;s mortality and the transience of time as literature&#x2019;s supreme subjects. In this I again see evasion and even sentimentality. The tragic sense of life is a partial response to experience. It is a reflex of the West&#x2019;s resistance to and misapprehension of nature, compounded by the errors of liberalism, which in its Romantic nature-philosophy has followed the Rousseauist Wordsworth rather than the daemonic Coleridge.<br><br>Tragedy is the most Western literary genre. It did not appear in Japan until the late nineteenth century. The Western will, setting itself up against nature, dramatized its own inevitable fall as a human universal, which it is not. An irony of literary history is the birth of tragedy in the cult of Dionysus. The protagonist&#x2019;s destruction recalls the slaughter of animals and, even earlier, of real human beings in archaic ritual. It is no accident that tragedy as we know it dates from the Apollonian fifth century of Athens&#x2019;s greatness, whose cardinal work is Aeschylus&#x2019;s Oresteia, a celebration of the defeat of chthonian power. Drama, a Dionysian mode, turned against Dionysus in making the passage from ritual to mimesis, that is, from action to representation. Aristotle&#x2019;s &#x201c;pity and fear&#x201d; is a broken promise, a plea for vision without horror.<br><br>Few Greek tragedies fully conform to the humanist commentary on them. Their barbaric residue will not come unglued. Even in the fifth century, as we shall see, a satiric response to Apollonianized theater came in Euripides&#x2019;s decadent plays. Problems in accurate assessment of Greek tragedy include not only the loss of three-quarters of the original body of work but the lack of survival of any complete satyr-play. This was the finale to the classic trilogy, an obscene comic burlesque. In Greek tragedy, comedy always had the last word. Modern criticism has projected a Victorian and, I feel, Protestant high seriousness upon pagan culture that still blankets teaching of the humanities. Paradoxically, assent to savage chthonian realities leads not to gloom but to humor. Hence Sade&#x2019;s strange laughter, his wit amid the most fantastic cruelties. For life is not a tragedy but a comedy. Comedy is born of the clash between Apollo and Dionysus. Nature is always pulling the rug out from under our pompous ideals.</p><h2>Angel City</h2><p>After leaving their failed farm in West Virginia, Jared Teeter and his family make their way to Florida, with dreams of fishing, going to the beach, and running their own roadside produce stand.

"<br>A native of Mendenhall, Mississippi, Patrick Smith earned both a B.A. and a master's degree in English from the University of Mississippi. He moved to Florida in 1966 and began writing the novels about Florida that would make bring him lifelong recognition: The River Is Home, The Beginning, Forever Island, Angel City, Allapattah, and A Land Remembered. Smith has been nominated three times for the Pulitzer Prize: in 1973 for Forever Island, which was a 1974 selection of Reader's Digest Condensed Books; in 1978 for Angel City, which was produced as a movie of the week for the CBS television network; and in 1984 for A Land Remembered, which was an Editors' Choice selection of the New York Times Book Review. In the annual statewide Best of Florida poll conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine, A Land Remembered has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times. In 1985 Smith's lifetime work was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 1999 he was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, which is the highest cultural honor bestowed by the state of Florida. In May 2002 Smith was the recipient of the Florida Historical Society's Fay Schweim Award as the &#x201c;Greatest Living Floridian.&#x201d; The one-time-only award was established to honor the one individual who has contributed the most to Florida in recent history. Additionally, Smith earned the 2012 Florida Lifetime Achievement Award for Writing presented by the Florida Humanities Council.

In <i>Rave On</i>, writer Philip Norman proposes that Holly was even more influential in the genre's development than previously credited.

Holly's aura of mystery was much more suited to England, which was still recovering from post-war depression, and his reception there was unprecedented. His music played a major role in igniting English youth, and his low-key approach to energized rhythms and rebellion influenced many groups--including the Beatles--to play rock-and-roll.Philip Norman is a journalist and a novelist who in 1968 was assigned to cover the Beatles&#x2019; own business utopia, Apple Corps, from the inside.

Some listeners may be turned off by this confident girl's relentless self-praise, but many will appreciate her obvious pride and enjoyment in herself. And whether the message appeals or not, there's no denying that it's packaged perfectly. The catchy, creative text begins with a focus on basic body parts ("Nobody has my singular nose/Nobody tips on my ten toes") and continues as the unnamed narrator lists numerous other unique (yet universal) traits before declaring, "I'm the pearl in the oyster, the A to the Z/I'm the one, the only, incredible Me!" The playful use of language keeps the tone light. The illustrations are buoyant and playful as well, as the girl with carrot-colored hair dances her way through cozy interiors and imaginary outdoor scenes. Occasionally, patterns and textures give the crisp illustrations the look of a collage; the overall design is delightfully simple and focused on the narrator. The ongoing demand for books intended to boost children's self-esteem will make this title a useful addition.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Is Administrative Law Unlawful?</h2><p><p>Is administrative law unlawful? This provocative question has become all the more significant with the expansion of the modern administrative state. While the federal government traditionally could constrain liberty only through acts of Congress and the courts, the executive branch has increasingly come to control Americans through its own administrative rules and adjudication, thus raising disturbing questions about the effect of this sort of state power on American government and society.</p> <p><br> With <i>Is Administrative Law Unlawful?,</i> Philip Hamburger answers this question in the affirmative, offering a revisionist account of administrative law. Rather than accepting it as a novel power necessitated by modern society, he locates its origins in the medieval and early modern English tradition of royal prerogative. Then he traces resistance to administrative law from the Middle Ages to the present. Medieval parliaments periodically tried to confine the Crown to governing through regular law, but the most effective response was the seventeenth-century development of English constitutional law, which concluded that the government could rule only through the law of the land and the courts, not through administrative edicts. Although the US Constitution pursued this conclusion even more vigorously, administrative power reemerged in the Progressive and New Deal Eras. Since then, Hamburger argues, administrative law has returned American government and society to precisely the sort of consolidated or absolute power that the US Constitution&#x2014;and constitutions in general&#x2014;were designed to prevent.</p> <p><br> With a clear yet many-layered argument that draws on history, law, and legal thought, <i>Is Administrative Law Unlawful?</i> reveals administrative law to be not a benign, natural outgrowth of contemporary government but a pernicious&#x2014;and profoundly unlawful&#x2014;return to dangerous pre-constitutional absolutism.</p></p><p><b>Philip Hamburger</b> is the Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at Columbia Law School. He is the author of <i>The Administrative Threat</i>, <i>Is Administrative Law Unlawful?</i>, <i>Law and Judicial Duty</i>, and S<i>eparation of Church and State</i>.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Is Administrative Law Unlawful?</i> is a work of the very highest quality, a learned scholarly exegesis setting out the intellectual foundations&#x2014;in medieval and early modern English constitutional thought&#x2014;for the proposition that the contemporary American administrative state is profoundly unconstitutional and unlawful. Philip Hamburger&#x2019;s argument is intricately wrought and forcefully expressed. Its indictment of modern administration in America doubles as a major statement on the virtues of a genuinely constitutional government.&#x201d;<br> (Ken I. Kersch, Boston College)<br><br>"With characteristic erudition, Philip Hamburger shows how virtually every aspect of the modern administrative state undermines the Anglo-American legal tradition&#x2015;or at least that part of the tradition that most informed the American founding. It is a provocative thesis, but one that is amply supported by extensive scholarly argument and fascinating historical study. Hamburger makes an impressive case that modern administrative law&nbsp;owes its lineage to claims of monarchical prerogative and civil law absolutism that were precisely the ideas that the American revolution was trying to reject.

(Scott Johnson <i>Power Line</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The administrative state is a modern invention. It was, and remains, a necessity in our complex modern age. Or so goes the argument. . . .

Each chapter ends with a section of notes and sources, which is very interesting, well written and extremely useful for the readers. <br>The author develops the material from basic concepts and attempts to make accessible a number of topics that are not often found in textbooks. In the entire book, the presentation style is very clear, unique, compact and easy to follow, but at the same time mathematically rigorous. All the algorithms are clearly explained and presented. The organization of the book makes it possible to use it both as a textbook and as a reference book. Researchers as well as professionals in applied mathematics will also find this book very useful. Overall, this book is an excellent contribution to the field of optimization, and it is highly recommended to the students and researchers in Nonlinear Programming. -- Review by S.

Affectionately called &#x201c;the Supremes,&#x201d; they survived the racial tensions of the &#x2018;60s, splintering families, and complicated love affairs by always having each other&#x2019;s backs. Now that they&#x2019;ve reached their sixties, still living seemingly happy lives in their home town, Earl&#x2019;s sudden passing isn&#x2019;t the only trigger for their own post-mid-life crises. Feisty, steady Odette has been seeing a lot of her mother--who happens to be dead, and palling around with the misbehaving spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt. Clarice, always so concerned with keeping up appearances, has decided her philandering husband no longer gets a pass. And the greatest love of Barbara Jean&#x2019;s past has returned, dredging up a harrowing loss she numbs with vodka.

Many fine books are available which provide instruction in techniques. The intent of this text is to serve as a look-up book. My own library of jewelry texts is full of illustrations, examples and how-tos. I found that once I read a new book, it went on the shelf until I needed to find a formula, definition or mathematical data. The question was always, where was that bit of information in all those books? <p>The time came to collect all the data my students and I required and compile a comprehensive reference. Years in the classroom, at the bench and speaking with colleagues led to the material contained in this reference. Some of it is easily found in any jewelry text. Much of the information is difficult to find, some nearly impossible without encyclopedic references. Most jewelry texts ignore gemology and legal information entirely. Material newly generated for this text (example, ring blank size strips) has been tested over the years in my own shop and classroom. </p><p>Revisions included in this publication have been made after suggestions collected over the past five years. </p><p>The format, type size and structure of this work is intended to make it an easy reference tool. It can take its place on a desk or at the bench, where a tool belongs. Continue to build a library of how-to books; use this book. </p><p>Jeweler's Resource has become a standard reference in the jewelry industry. This revised and expanded edition includes a new section on diamond grading standards, enhanced ring size information, additional metal weight charts and formulae, and even more entries in the extensive glossary. It serves as the most complete jewelry bench reference available. </p><p>Written as a unique and practical tool for the bench jeweler and jewelry student. It also serves as the most complete counter reference available to the retail jeweler. Easy to follow text and illustrations. </p><p>Also included: </p><p>an extensive listing of gems and gem properties, diagrams of more than forty gem cutting styles, </p><p>complete lists of birthstones and birthstone alternatives, the metaphysical properties of gems, </p><p>legal standards for diamond, gold and silver marketing,formulas and chemical preparations, </p><p>unique ring size gauges and a complete listings of international ring sizes, </p><p>mathematical formulas for jewelers, and comprehensive measurement conversion and comparison tables, </p><p>an illustrated glossary of over 500 jewelry and gemology terms, </p><p>the composition and standards of all common jewelry metals</p></p><p>The success of Jeweler&#39;s Resource has been very satisfying. The 1994 edition was met with critical praise and ready acceptance in the jewelry industry. This comprehensive reference has now been expanded to include even more information requested by readers. Without sacrificing any of the valued material of the first edition, Knuth has added more value for easy reference at the bench or in dealing with customers.Previous reviews and sales told me I had written a book needed by jewelers. The acceptance of this easy to read reference has been great over the past six years. Responding to requests from my readers, I am pleased to offer this revised and expanded edition.</p><h2>The Lords of Creation: The History of America&#39;s 1 Percent (Forbidden Bookshelf)</h2><p><b>A &#x201c;stimulating&#x201d; account of the capitalists who changed America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, setting the stage for the 1929 crash and Great Depression (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</b><br><br> In the decades following the Civil War, America entered an era of unprecedented corporate expansion, with ultimate financial power in the hands of a few wealthy industrialists who exploited the system for everything it was worth. The Rockefellers, Fords, Morgans, and Vanderbilts were the &#x201c;lords of creation&#x201d; who, along with like-minded magnates, controlled the economic destiny of the country, unrestrained by regulations or moral imperatives. Through a combination of foresight, ingenuity, ruthlessness, and greed, America&#x2019;s giants of industry remolded the US economy in their own image. They established their power and authority, ensuring that they&#x2014;and they alone&#x2014;would control the means of production, transportation, energy, and commerce&#x2014;creating the conditions for the stock market collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.<br><br> As modern society continues to be affected by wealth inequality and cycles of boom and bust, it&#x2019;s as important as ever to understand the origins of financial disaster, and the policies, practices, and people who bring them on. <i>The Lords of Creation</i>, first published when the catastrophe of the 1930s was still painfully fresh, is a fascinating story of bankers, railroad tycoons, steel magnates, speculators, scoundrels, and robber barons. It is a tale of innovation and shocking exploitation&#x2014;and a sobering reminder that history can indeed repeat itself.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Frederick Lewis Allen (1890&#x2013;1954) was born in Boston, studied at Groton, and graduated from Harvard in 1912.

But her classmates don&#39;t think it looks quite so yummy. &#34;Ick!&#34; says one of the Franks. &#34;It&#39;s seaweed!&#34; They&#39;re not even impressed by her red bean ice cream dessert. Of course, Mrs. Jenkins has a plan that might solve Yoko&#39;s problem. But will it work with the other children in class? Now in paperback for the first time, this tender story from Rosemary Wells demonstrates the author&#39;s uncanny understanding of the pleasures and pains of an ordinary school day.</p><p>It is Yoko's first day at school, so of course her mother wants to send her off with healthy comfort food for lunch--a delectable package of homemade sushi. "Have a wonderful day at school, my Little Cherry Blossom," her mother says as Yoko climbs into the bus. And it would have been, had it not been for lunchtime. Timothy brings a peanut butter and honey sandwich. Tulip has Swiss cheese on rye. The Franks brothers have beans and franks. But when Yoko opens her cooler of rice rolls with "the crispiest cucumber, the pinkest shrimp, the greenest seaweed, and the tastiest tuna," one of the Franks brothers announces, "Ick. It's green. It's seaweed." Tulip and Fritz chime in, "Yuck-o-rama."<p> Rosemary Wells (<i>Voyage to the Bunny Planet</i>), with her expressive, bright-eyed, chubby-cheeked animal kingdom, has once again successfully tapped into the emotional world of children. The embarrassment of bringing an uncool lunch to school! What child hasn't wanted to hide under the cafeteria table when caught with a gooey enchilada or a slice of vegetarian lentil loaf? Fortunately, Yoko's teacher concocts a plan to stop the teasing. Parents who have more ambitious hopes for their children's lunches than Fritos, PB&amp;Js, and Oreos will be relieved to discover that the happy ending does not include Yoko's giving up her comfort meal or, more importantly, her heritage. (Ages 4 and older) <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>PreSchool-Grade 2-Yoko, a gray kitten, is crushed when her classmates (including Fritz, Tulip, and Hazel from previous titles by Wells) mock her favorite sushi lunch. Her plight, however, is noticed by her teacher. Under the guise of International Food Day, the resourceful Mrs. Jenkins encourages the insensitive students to bring in a dish from a foreign country and "Everyone must try a bite of everything." Yoko is further humiliated when her sushi remains untouched. However, Timothy's appetite leads him to the sushi cooler where he discovers crab cones. The next day, he and Yoko share dragon rolls and tomato sandwiches. A class song for every activity, the group dynamics, even the students' clothing and their sandwich fixings perfectly capture the grade school experience. The watercolor-and-ink illustrations vary from full page to postage stamp size and enhance the pacing of the brief text and the realistically contemporary dialogue. Every child's need for peer acceptance and dread of being "different" are addressed in an affirming and believable manner. The sushi endpapers and Yoko's beguiling smile on the title page introduce this newest heroine, and the eclectic but satisfying menu at the conclusion of the tale speaks volumes about open-mindedness. Just as Yoko's mother carefully crafted the delectable sushi, Wells, too, has tucked a real treasure in this tasty morsel of a tale.<br><i>Carol Ann Wilson, Westfield Memorial Library, NJ</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Dark Lure</h2><p><p>Twelve years ago, Sarah Baker was abducted by the Watt Lake Killer and sexually assaulted for months before managing to escape.

In 2009, she saw an advertisement for a job at the University of Iceland and applied on a whim, despite having two young children and a comfortable life in Kent. The resulting adventure was shaped by Iceland&#x2019;s economic collapse, which halved the value of her salary, by the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull and by a collection of new friends, including a poet who saw the only bombs fall on Iceland in 1943, a woman who speaks to elves and a chef who guided Sarah&#x2019;s family around the intricacies of Icelandic cuisine.<br><br>Moss explored hillsides of boiling mud and volcanic craters and learned to drive like an Icelander on the unsurfaced roads that link remote farms and fishing villages in the far north. She watched the northern lights and the comings and goings of migratory birds, and as the weeks and months went by, she and her family learned new ways to live.<br><br><i>Names for the Sea</i> is her compelling, beautiful and very funny account of living in a country poised on the edge of Europe, where modernization clashes with living folklore.<br></p><p><b>Sarah Moss</b> was educated at Oxford University and is Associate Professor of Creative Writing at Warwick University. She is the author of two critically acclaimed novels: <i>Cold Earth</i> and <i>Night Walking</i>, which was selected for the Fiction Uncovered Award in 2011, and the co-author of <i>Chocolate: A Global History</i>. She spent 2009-10 as a visiting lecturer at the University of Iceland and now lives in west Cornwall.<br>The author&#x2019;s domestic adventures, challenges in understanding and adjusting to life in a cold and strange place, and admiration for the beauty of Iceland fill this meandering travel memoir of the year she and her family (husband and two small children) lived in Reykjavik while teaching at the University of Iceland. Moss, an Oxford-educated British novelist, captures the fierce beauty of the Arctic landscape, the hardships of establishing family life as foreigners on a local salary in a nation suffering an economic collapse, and most interestingly, the paradoxes of the national character. Icelanders &#x201c;seem both outward-looking and insular, a nation of deeply provincial voyagers&#x201d; who welcome foreigners but remain stoic, taciturn, and, at times, inscrutable. Moss is at her best when trying to make sense of the great pride and shame-filled inferiority that coexist within the people she meets. Her admirable prose on the weather, the light, volcanoes, and Icelandic folklore is interspersed, sadly, with repetitive laments about the subpar quality of imported fruit, lack of fresh vegetables, and Icelanders&#x2019; dependence on the automobile in a climate that is subfreezing nine months a year. --Jonathan Schwartz</p><h2>Ed Emberley&#39;s Picture Pie Two (Drawing Book Series;)</h2><p>Using just a few simple shapes on a free stencil that is provided, Ed Emberley shows would-be artists how to pigs, wolves, clowns, bugs, trains, and much more!

I&#x2019;d have to move the pride before it landed.</p><p>&#x201c;Theo!&#x201d; I called. The Bushman was sitting on the hood of the Land Cruiser, and when he looked my way, I pointed at the three lionesses and two cubs sunning themselves on the hard-packed sand. Laughing, he leaned backward and honked the horn of the truck, his way of saying we&#x2019;d have to chase them off. I nodded and ran back to the Cruiser, tossing my folder of papers in the backseat.</p><p>In a moment, I had the engine roaring and we were off, rattling down the runway toward the sleeping lions. They yawned and chuffed at me in a lazy attempt to scare me off, but I bore down on them. I recognized the pride; the lionesses were sisters, used to us rambling around the bush. They barely opened their eyes as the truck trundled up to them.</p><p>I stopped the Cruiser, leaving the engine running, and climbed onto the hood. From there, I shouted and waved my arms, to the amusement of the cubs, who rolled and yowled and stretched. At last, their mothers lifted themselves up huffily and ambled off the runway. They were soon lost in the waving golden grass, their tawny coats blending into the dry savanna. Just the black tips of their tails showed, flickering slyly above the foliage, and then those too vanished.</p><p>I drove the truck back to the other end of the runway and parked it, then grabbed my folder out of the backseat. The plane was dropping lower in the sky, lining up with the runway.</p><p>Theo glanced at me sidelong. He was part Bushman, with the lovely golden skin characteristic of his nomadic ancestors, and though he was older than my father, he was no taller than I was. He had found a praying mantis somewhere, and the insect was crawling over his hands, from one to the other. As soon as it crawled onto one hand, he lifted the other and placed it in front, so that the mantis was continually crawling forward but getting nowhere. Theo could charm any creature that walked, crawled, flew, or slithered.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you got a toothache, girl,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks,&#x201d; I murmured, my eyes still on the plane. &#x201c;What are we going to do with five teenagers from the city for two weeks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a teenager.&#x201d; He grinned, taking far too much delight in my dismay. &#x201c;I am sure you will have a grand time.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. A grand old time.&#x201d; I sank lower in my seat and flipped open the folder, riffling through the documents inside. &#x201c;I went to school for three months in the States once, did you know that? The kids in my class called me Mowgli and threw bananas at me during lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is the problem? At the end of the day, it was you who ended up with all the bananas.&#x201d; Theo turned in his seat, and though he was still smiling, his dark eyes were serious. &#x201c;Tu!um-sa, it will be good for you. You cannot live your whole life with only animals for friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can try.&#x201d; I sighed and shut the folder. &#x201c;Here they come.&#x201d; </p><p>The plane touched down in a cloud of dust, its silver sides reflecting golden grass and blue sky. It taxied down the short length and then turned, the propeller whipping up a whirlwind of sand. Theo and I got out of the truck and walked toward the plane, and I held my scarf over my mouth and nose to keep from breathing in the dust.</p><p>After the engine died and the propeller wound down, the pilot ran around the front of the plane and opened the passenger door. I drew a deep breath and put on what I hoped looked like a welcoming smile.</p><p>&#x201c;And here we go,&#x201d; I muttered through my teeth.</p><p>An Asian boy with a bright red baseball cap cocked sideways over his long, shaggy hair tumbled out of the plane. The pilot, a young Frenchman named Matthieu, was standing at the door and tried to help him out, but the kid ignored him and fell to the ground, where he promptly puked onto the hard-packed sand.</p><p>I winced and consulted the papers I was carrying, quickly putting a name to our first guest&#x2019;s greenish face: Joey Xiong. From California. Seventeen years old, Hmong American. Listed Sasquatch as his favorite animal. I hoped his sickness was due to the plane ride and not a sign of something worse. The last thing we needed was flu or malaria in our camp. The nearest hospital was an hour&#x2019;s flight away.</p><p>Next out was a tall, graceful girl with springy dark hair. She paused in the doorway, half bent over, and stared at the spot where Joey had deposited his breakfast. For a moment it seemed as if she would turn around and go back inside the plane, but Matthieu offered a hand and she gingerly stepped down, her expression a mask of disgust. While Joey lurched to his feet, she pointedly stood a few steps away from him and stared in the other direction. Avani Sharma, her profile paper read. Canadian, of Indian and Kenyan heritage. 4.0 GPA. The list of her academic achievements, recorded there for no apparent reason, was long enough to put some college professors to shame.</p><p>I let out a little breath, trying to force my thoughts to stay positive, as the next two guests exited the plane: a boy and a girl so entangled with each other that it was hard to see where one ended and the other began. They were both dark haired and pale skinned. They had on khaki from head to toe, but they wore it as if they&#x2019;d just arrived for a Burberry photo shoot&#x2014;his shirt was partially unbuttoned, her beige scarf was arranged in a complex knot, and they were both sporting manicured, immaculate hairstyles. There was no denying they were both drop-dead gorgeous and deeply obsessed with each other.</p><p>They could only be Miranda Kirk and Kase Rider of Boston, Massachusetts. They had come together and they were both seventeen. Other than that, the profiles they had filled out were scant on information. The space asking why they were here at all&#x2014;Please state what you hope to gain from this experience&#x2014;was blank on Miranda&#x2019;s, while Kase&#x2019;s form said only wildlife photography portfolio.</p><p>They jumped to the ground without taking their arms from around each other, then stood between Avani and Joey, whispering in each other&#x2019;s ears and regarding the surrounding wilderness with suspicious looks.</p><p>Last out of the plane was a boy who must have been, by process of elimination, Sam Quartermain, our final guest: shaggy dark blond hair, a plain white tee tucked messily into his jeans, carrying a tattered Adidas duffel bag. The moment his shoes hit the ground, his head was up and his eyes were wide, scanning the trees around us and finally settling on me. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he called out, the first of them to even acknowledge my presence. &#x201c;Sarah, right? I&#x2019;m Sam!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Sam.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mind if I take a picture?&#x201d; said Kase, pulling out a camera roughly the size of a lawn mower engine.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, no?&#x201d;</p><p>Sweet.&#x201d; He held up his camera and the shutter clicked. Then Kase cursed and fiddled with the dials. &#x201c;Crap. Settings are all screwed up.&#x201d;</p><p>Miranda shielded her eyes from the sun as she whipped out her phone, her fingers a blur as they navigated the touch screen. &#x201c;Ugh! No service? Are you kidding me?&#x201d;</p><p>I suppressed a sigh and nodded to Matthieu. &#x201c;Salut, Matt. Bon vol?&#x201d;</p><p>He grunted and began unloading the boxes of food and necessities I&#x2019;d ordered from our supplier in Maun. &#x201c;Je ne t&#x2019;envie pas vraiment dans cette situation. C&#x2019;est aussi amusant qu&#x2019;un panier de serpents.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t envy you with this lot. They&#x2019;re about as much fun as a box of snakes.</p><p>Easy for him to say. I was the sort of person who, upon arriving at someone&#x2019;s house on a social visit, ended up making friends with his or her canary instead. I&#x2019;d take a box of snakes over these five any day. But as Dad was fond of saying, &#x201c;We must soldier on, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, everyone,&#x201d; I said, clearing my throat. They&#x2019;re just people. Get it together. &#x201c;Um, I&#x2019;m Sarah Carmichael and this is Theo. Welcome to the Kalahari.&#x201d;</p><p>Beside me, Theo flashed his brightest smile and said, &#x201c;Hello, hello,&#x201d; in his soft accent. I was glad I&#x2019;d brought him along to meet the plane, because he immediately began putting everyone at ease, shaking hands, taking Miranda&#x2019;s and Avani&#x2019;s bags and pretending they were too heavy for him. Avani smiled a little, but Miranda rolled her eyes. Only Sam and Joey laughed, and Theo gave them a grin and a shrug as if to say, Girls, eh?</p><p>&#x201c;Climb aboard,&#x201d; I said, waving at the battered green Land Cruiser. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a tight fit. You&#x2019;ll have to hold your bags. We&#x2019;re about a ten-minute drive from the camp.&#x201d;</p><p>As the group climbed into the Cruiser, I made a quick check of the supplies Matthieu had brought and then left Theo to stand guard over them until I returned with the car to load them up.</p><p>The Cruiser choked to life as I turned the key, and the whole thing began vibrating like it was about to fall apart. I heard a little shriek from behind me but couldn&#x2019;t tell who it was.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Hank,&#x201d; I shouted over the engine, slapping the dash. &#x201c;He sounds like a trash compactor, but he&#x2019;s the only thing that&#x2019;ll get through this terrain.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned the Cruiser around and rumbled down the track to the camp. The sides were all open and the canvas roof was rolled back, allowing the passengers a 360-degree view of the Kalahari semidesert.</p><p>A dry wind blasted my face, pulling my hair out of its messy braid and nearly sucking the wide-brimmed sun hat off my head. All around us, the graceful acacias and stocky Terminalia swayed and rustled, and a lone chanting goshawk cut the air above, hunting for mice in the tall golden grass. Behind us, Matthieu&#x2019;s plane grunted to life, and moments later I saw him climbing into the sky ahead of us, destined for Maun and his next group of tourists to ferry through the cloudless Botswana sky.</p><p>When I looked down again, I realized there was a face hovering beside mine and I jumped, gripping the wheel harder and biting back a curse. It was the one named Joey. His baseball cap was now backward, and a sprig of his black hair sprouted over the Velcro strap.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Joey,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Nice wheels. Very rugged. I like a girl who can drive manual. And on the wrong side of the car too.&#x201d; </p><p>In response, I kicked the Cruiser into third gear and gave<br>him a tight smile.</p><p>I desperately wished we didn&#x2019;t have to do this, but my dad&#x2019;s conservation research needed all the funding it could get, and in return for babysitting four American (and one Canadian) students on a conservation exchange program, we&#x2019;d receive a research grant from the Song Foundation. We might even be able to buy another vehicle, which we sorely needed. It wasn&#x2019;t a good idea to be this far out into the Kalahari bush with only one form of transportation readily available, not with the way the terrain around here destroys cars. We&#x2019;d had a second car, until Mom&#x2019;s accident.</p><p>I turned to Joey and smiled a bit wider. &#x201c;Have a good flight over?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh! Dude, did you see me hurl?&#x201d; He laughed and elbowed Sam. &#x201c;You totally shouldn&#x2019;t have let me eat all those sausages in the airport, man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You guys know each other?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nah, met on the plane from JFK. Totally bonded though. We did a Die Hard marathon on the flight over, but my man Sam here conked out halfway through number three. Yippee-ki-yay!&#x201d;</p><p>Joey&#x2019;s chatter continued, most of it blasted away by the wind, but I nodded and pretended to listen as I navigated the Cruiser through the treacherous sand. There&#x2019;s not a single stone to be found in the Kalahari, just endless deep sand, white in the north and fading to red in the south, the nemesis of every vehicle that attempts to cross it. I&#x2019;d lost count of how many times Dad, Theo, and I had had to dig this thing out. It was the reason why I had &#x201c;muscles like a rugby fullback,&#x201d; according to my dad. He&#x2019;s from New Zealand, and in his view, everything on the planet can be analogized to rugby.</p><p>We startled a pair of tall gray kudu, and they froze in front of the car, their huge dark eyes fixed on the great gray-green monster that had interrupted their grazing. At once, everyone behind me was leaning forward, and I stopped to let them get a better look. Kase&#x2019;s zoom lens extended over Joey&#x2019;s shoulder as he snapped a ream of photos. Avani suddenly spoke up, identifying the &#x201c;two young female kudu, called cows, scientific name Tragelaphus strepsiceros&#x201d; and rattling off a stream of kudu-related information as deftly as any safari guide.</p><p>As the car approached them, the kudu leaped into fluid motion, disappearing into the brush in three steps. They weren&#x2019;t called the &#x201c;gray ghosts of the bush&#x201d; for nothing; despite their size&#x2014;they stood as tall as horses&#x2014;they could vanish in moments into the dry vegetation.</p><p>The group let out a collective sigh and then they all fell silent, now on high alert for more animal activity, but we reached the camp without seeing anything more exciting than a few sparrows and fork-tailed drongos.</p><p>My dad was waiting. He stood with a warm smile and an armful of bottled water, outfitted in his usual khaki gear, rugged and faded like a worn photograph that&#x2019;s been handled too many times. He looked older than he was, tanned and leathery from spending all his time underneath the suns of a dozen wildernesses, from the Burmese jungles to the Australian outback and now the Kalahari savanna, charting migratory patterns and documenting the myriad ways humans were destroying the natural world. His long graying hair was tied in a ponytail at the back of his head, though a few wispy strands had escaped.</p><p>As soon as our guests&#x2019; feet touched the ground, my dad introduced himself, his strong Kiwi accent booming across the grass. &#x201c;Welcome to our little corner of the Kalahari, boys and girls! My name&#x2019;s Ty Carmichael, and I&#x2019;m the head researcher here at Camp Acacia.&#x201d;</p><p>You&#x2019;re the only researcher here, I thought, shaking my head a little.</p><p>&#x201c;Camp Acacia&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t much of a camp. There was my tent, Dad and Theo&#x2019;s shared one, and then there were the two new ones we&#x2019;d put up that morning to accommodate the guests&#x2014;one for boys, one for girls. The tents were large enough. You could stand up straight if you were right in the middle of them, and they kept out rain (for the most part), if not bugs and the occasional snake or wildcat. There was a fire pit in the middle of the camp, surrounded by logs for seating, and a portable shower was set up in the trees nearby. It was about as crude a camp as you could ask for, but it had been my home for the past five years, more or less, and resembled every other camp I&#x2019;d lived in as my family moved from one remote location to the next.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the lodge?&#x201d; asked Miranda.</p><p>Silence fell. We all stared at her. She took off her designer sunglasses and gave my dad a bewildered look through mascara-laced eyelashes, then turned to her boyfriend.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh . . . Mir . . .&#x201d; coughed Kase, looking a bit pale.</p><p>&#x201c;You said there would be a lodge,&#x201d; she replied to him, quite loudly. &#x201c;You distinctly promised there would be a lodge! The only reason I agreed to come on this&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miranda, listen, I might not have mentioned . . .&#x201d; Kase reached for her hand.</p><p>She slipped her shades back on and folded her arms, ...</p></p><h2>Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation (Relational Perspectives Book Series)</h2><p><p>In this volume, <i>Traumatic Narcissism: Relational Systems of Subjugation, </i><b>Daniel Shaw</b> presents a way of understanding the traumatic impact of narcissism as it is engendered developmentally, and as it is enacted relationally. Focusing on the dynamics of narcissism in interpersonal relations, <b>Shaw </b>describes the relational system of what he terms the 'traumatizing narcissist' as a system of subjugation &#x2013; the objectification of one person in a relationship as the means of enforcing the dominance of the subjectivity of the other.</p> <p><b>Daniel Shaw </b>illustrates the workings of this relational system of subjugation in a variety of contexts: theorizing traumatic narcissism as an intergenerationally transmitted relational/developmental trauma; and exploring the clinician's experience working with the adult children of traumatizing narcissists. He explores the relationship of cult leaders and their followers, and examines how traumatic narcissism has lingered vestigially in some aspects of the psychoanalytic profession.</p> <p>Bringing together theories of trauma and attachment, intersubjectivity and complementarity, and the rich clinical sensibility of the Relational Psychoanalysis tradition, <b>Shaw </b>demonstrates how narcissism can best be understood not merely as character, but as the result of the specific trauma of subjugation, in which one person is required to become the object for a significant other who demands hegemonic subjectivity. <i>Traumatic Narcissism </i>presents therapeutic clinical opportunities not only for psychoanalysts of different schools, but for all mental health professionals working with a wide variety of modalities. Although primarily intended for the professional psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, this is also a book that therapy patients and lay readers will find highly readable and illuminating. </p></p><p><b>Daniel Shaw</b>, LCSW is a psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapist in private practice in New York City, and in Nyack, New York. He is a training analyst, teacher and supervisor of analytic candidates at the National Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York City.

To these irreplaceable resources, Shaw adds not only his extensive studies of the precise mechanisms of soul destruction in cults and cult-like groups (such as allegedly therapeutic cults and the large group awareness trainings&#x2015;LGATs) , as well as his own description of cult-like families ruled by traumatizing narcissists."</em><strong> <br>-Donna Orange,<em> International Journal of Psychoanalytic Self Psychology </em></strong></p> <p><em>"This is a serious, clearly written, clinically informed book written from an insider's perspective. Shaw inhabits the experiential worlds he depicts, and he knows his subject deeply. WEaving together disparate threads, Shaw works toward a position that places our willingness to acknowledge vulnerability and need, and our ability to withstand shame, as the cornerstones of transformational therapy work. Shaw's writing seeks and inspires partnership. His efforts to grapple with his subject invite our participation as readers. He demonstrates expertise, but his voice is not that of the expert. He writes in an egalitarian spirit... I highly recommend Shaw's instructive and evocative work and have, on more than a few occasions, recommended it to friends, students, and patients whose responses confirm my sense that this is a book with much to teach us. Shaw's book should and, I supsect, will inspire considerable interest in our field and will facilitate a useful critical analysis of our clinical approaches to working with the narcissistic dimension of experience." -</em><strong>Eric Mendelsohn, <em>Division|Review</em></strong></p> <p><em>"Readers will be compelled by Daniel Shaw's differentiated and lucid account of relational trauma and non-recognition in the shaping of what has been called narcissism. The book's intelligent and compassionate portrayal of clinical dilemmas involved in working with those who have suffered in abusive subjugating relationships is ideal for students and advanced practitioners. Traumatic Narcissism offers an original and captivating analysis of the relational configurations and painful emotions that lead to and so often prevent emergence from submission. While his thinking is informed by a broad theoretical knowledge, equally impressive is Shaw's exemplary dedication to exploring how we can use our own experience and personal honesty in order to transcend shame and confront the pitfalls of being an analyst while still maintaining our focus on recognizing the patient."</em> - <b>Jessica Benjamin, author </b><b>of</b> <b><i>Shadow of the Other</i></b></p><i> </i><p><i>"Daniel Shaw has written a fascinating book that places his personal psychological journey in the well-researched context of his larger compelling theory of traumatic narcissism. Inspired by his own experience in a cult with a guru whom he eventually came to see as a traumatizing narcissist, and enlivened with numerous clinical case examples, this absorbing and far-ranging book traces the history of traumatic narcissism from ancient times to the vagaries of the current political scene."</i> - <b>Sheldon Bach, PhD, Adjunct Clinical Professor of Psychology, NYU Post Doctorial Program in Psychoanalysis</b></p><i> </i><p><i>"This book is a must-read for any of us who have worked with victims of traumatizing narcissists or been their victims ourselves. Whether drawing on his personal experience in the clinic and in cults, or analyzing literary productions and the inner worlds of their creators, Dan Shaw brings vividly to life the relational world of those bent on subjugating others -- and of those who have been subjugated by them. Not since Benjamin&#x2019;s The Bonds of Love has there been such a powerful analysis of the psychic life of domination and submission, complemented by a moving account of the effect of analytic love. Perhaps only someone like Shaw, who has known firsthand the psychic effects and needs fulfilled by living in a world of traumatizing narcissists, could have provided such a compassionate and helpful guide for clinicians engaged in the painful work of helping those who have been drawn into the traumatizing narcissist&#x2019;s relational system." </i>- <b>Lynne Layton, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute for Psychoanalysis</b></p><b> <p></p></b><b> <p></p></b><i> </i><p><i>"Daniel Shaw has written an astute, dramatic portrayal of the traumatizing narcissist&#x2019;s subjugation and destruction of another&#x2019;s subjectivity as it emerges in families, cult-like groups and even in the psychoanalytic profession itself. He boldly offers "analytic love" as the avenue of restoration of subjectivity. Professionals of all levels will be riveted as they expand their understanding of these phenomena."</i> - <b>James L. Fosshage, Ph.D., Clinical Professor of Psychology, New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis</b></p> <p><em>"Dan Shaw's fine study of what he calls "traumatic narcissism" explores the toxic forms of self-involvement in areas as diverse as the life of Eugene O'Neill, a number of his patients, and in his own experience with a guru. Shaw is at his best, however, exploring some of the dark corners of the cultic world of psychoanalysis itself. He holds a mirror up to those who claim the authority of self-understanding. Not all reflect well. Wisely, for all the anger and despair in this book, Shaw ends in hope that is cautious but authentic."</em> <strong>- Charles B.

Anthony DeStefano, author of the bestselling<i> A Travel Guide to Heaven,</i> knew there had to be an answer to this mystery, so he set out on a quest to find prayers that God says yes to<i> all the time</i>. The result is an extraordinary new book that has the ability to dramatically change the lives of readers of all faiths. <br><br>Each short, powerful prayer in <i>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</i> addresses a particular problem people commonly face in life&#x2014;from accepting the existence of God to trying to make ends meet; from getting through terrible suffering to coping with everyday stress; from overcoming fear to finding your God-given destiny. Presented with a certainty and vigor that are sure to pique the interest of even those who are not spiritually inclined, these prayers will help readers find solutions to life&#x2019;s most difficult situations and provide meaningful and inspiring answers to the vexing questions we have about the purpose of our time on earth. <br><br>In a world awash with superficial self-help books and deceptive gimmicks, <i>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</i> is the real thing. Using hundreds of scriptural references to support his claims, DeStefano writes in a simple, straightforward, and uplifting manner that makes the most profound theological matters understandable to all. In the words of the author, &#x201c;This is a spiritual treasure chest that is available to everyone....This book is about prayers that work&#x2014;really, truly work.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Anthony DeStefano</b> is the best-selling author of several books, including <i>This Little Prayer of Mine</i>, <i>A Travel Guide to Heaven</i>, and <i>Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To</i>, which have sold a quarter-milion copies.

Can there be one that has been the source of more mental anguish and emotional confusion in the history of mankind?<br><br>It&#x2019;s ironic that a question that so many people struggle with is also one that can be answered most easily by God when we put it in the form of a prayer. For when we lift our minds and hearts in humility and say to God: &#x201c;<i>Please show me that you exist...Give me some sign that you are really up there somewhere</i>&#x201d; he is only too happy to respond&#x2014;sometimes with a speed that can astound us.<br><br>And yet people often spend decades of their life going round in circles trying to debate God&#x2019;s existence. They analyze the problem, research it, turn it over and over in their minds, go back and forth a thousand times, and at the end of the whole process, they&#x2019;re still not sure.<br><br>Why do people get caught in the &#x201c;faith maze&#x201d; so often? Probably because so many corollary questions flow from that basic question: Are we alone in the universe? Is death the end of the story? Is there a meaning to suffering? Is there a heaven or hell? Is there an ultimate plan for my life? The problem is that none of these issues can be discussed intelligently if the answer to the first question&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>Does God exist?</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;is no. If there is no God, then any talk about Providence and eternity is absurd. The funeral really is the end of the story, and life has no meaning beyond the day to day. As one of my theology professors used to say, it&#x2019;s the &#x201c;Looney Tunes&#x201d; philosophy of life, because like the old Warner Brothers cartoons, the only way to accurately describe death is with the phrase &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all, folks!&#x201d;<br><br>On the other hand, if there is a God, then a world of possibilities opens up to us. With God, not only does every human being live forever, but all the actions we take and decisions we make have a significance that extends far beyond the present moment. In fact, everything that happens to us in our life&#x2014;down to the tiniest, most insignificant detail&#x2014;is mysteriously tied to God&#x2019;s &#x201c;plan.&#x201d; (1)<br><br>There isn&#x2019;t much room for compromise here. Either we&#x2019;re alone in the world or we&#x2019;re not. Either we came about by chance or we were created for a reason. Either death is the end or it&#x2019;s the beginning. Either our situation is ultimately hopeless or it&#x2019;s ultimately blissful. There really can&#x2019;t be two more different or diametrically opposed worldviews.<br><br>So how can we come to grips with this most profound question? One way is through simple logic. In the long history of philosophy, many arguments have been put forward concerning the existence of God. Some of the greatest geniuses the world has ever known&#x2014;Aristotle, Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Spinoza, Pascal, Descartes, and Kant, to name a few&#x2014;have made the case that there <i>is</i> a God, and that he is a real, living being.<br><br>Some of these rational &#x201c;proofs&#x201d; are very famous. There is the so&#x2013;called cosmological argument, for instance, which asks the question &#x201c;Where did everything come from?&#x201d; There is the teleological argument, which points to the order and design of the universe and asserts that there must be a &#x201c;designer.&#x201d; There is the ontological argument, which is based on the concepts of perfection and existence. There are arguments from &#x201c;efficient causality,&#x201d; from &#x201c;contingency,&#x201d; from &#x201c;desire,&#x201d; from &#x201c;degrees of perfection,&#x201d; from &#x201c;miracles,&#x201d; from &#x201c;morality and conscience,&#x201d; and from &#x201c;reliable testimonies.&#x201d; The list goes on and on.<br><br>There isn&#x2019;t time to discuss these proofs here, but all of them are based on logic, observation of the physical world and our internal consciousness, and inductive or deductive reasoning. None is based on Scripture. None attempts to prove God&#x2019;s existence by asserting that &#x201c;the Bible says this or that.&#x201d;<br><br>These logical proofs can be extremely helpful, especially to someone who tends to think that it&#x2019;s not &#x201c;intelligent&#x201d; to believe in God or that religion somehow goes against science. But the problem is that sometimes people get so wrapped up in logic that they get <i>tied up</i> in it as well. They can forget that the solution they are looking for is right in front of their eyes and doesn&#x2019;t require any arguments at all.<br><br>In the case of faith, it&#x2019;s easy to overlook the most fundamental point of all, namely, that God is <i>not</i> an argument; he is <i>not</i> a syllogism; he is <i>not</i> even a concept. God is a living being. He has the ability to know things, to desire things, to create things, and to love things. He is fully aware and involved. He is <i>alive</i>.<br><br>Why is that so important? Because living beings don&#x2019;t have to be &#x201c;proved.&#x201d; They can be <i>shown</i>. If I want to prove to everyone that my uncle Frank exists, I don&#x2019;t have to mathematically demonstrate that fact. I don&#x2019;t have to produce his birth certificate, passport, driver&#x2019;s license, or Social Security card. I can if I wish, but I don&#x2019;t have to. There&#x2019;s a much simpler solution. If I want, I can just pick up the phone, give him a call, and say, &#x201c;Hi, Uncle Frank, how are you doing today?&#x201d; And if anyone had the audacity to doubt that my uncle was really a living, breathing person, and not just some figment of my imagination, all I&#x2019;d have to do is introduce them to him.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a similar situation when we discuss God. Yes, we can come up with all kinds of fancy arguments to prove his existence, but we don&#x2019;t have to. It&#x2019;s not a strict requirement. Because God is a living being, we can simply give him a &#x201c;call.&#x201d; Since he is really, truly alive, he is going to answer us and have a conversation with us&#x2014;maybe not in the exact same way as Uncle Frank would if we called him on the phone, but close.<br><br>Does that seem too easy? I promise it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s just that most people who have questions about God&#x2019;s existence have never even tried to make contact with him. They&#x2019;ve never made a sincere effort to suspend their doubts for one second and say: &#x201c;God, I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;re up there. In fact, I&#x2019;m having a big problem believing in you. But if you do exist, will you please do something to show me, so that I know for sure?&#x201d;<br><br>Do you know what will happen if you say this kind of prayer? God is going to answer you. He is going to say YES. He is going to show you that he exists. Why? Because God is not some cosmic joker. He is not interested in playing hide&#x2013;and&#x2013;seek with us. His goal is not to confound and confuse us for our entire lives. Yes, he wants us to have faith in something we can&#x2019;t see or touch, but he doesn&#x2019;t expect us to do the impossible. He doesn&#x2019;t expect us to believe in something or someone we can&#x2019;t even communicate with.<br><br>You see, communication is really the key to understanding the whole mystery of faith. In fact, the history of the world is really the history of God trying to communicate with mankind. (2) By creating the universe and the planets in the first place, God was essentially &#x201c;breaking the silence.&#x201d; By creating animals and human beings, he was making conversation possible. (3) By formulating covenants with Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David, he was taking the step of actually speaking to us. (4) By sending great prophets like Elijah and Isaiah to his chosen people, he was deepening his bond with us and &#x201c;revealing&#x201d; himself to us even more clearly. (5) God&#x2019;s most direct act of communication was to become a man in the person of Jesus Christ. By actually walking among us in bodily form and speaking to us plainly in our own language, God was doing everything he could to &#x201c;talk to us.&#x201d; And by sending his Holy Spirit, first to the Apostles on Pentecost Sunday and then to the rest of the world, God continues to communicate with us to this very day. (6)<br><br>The fact is that we have a God who loves to communicate. And the reason is that communication is the starting point for any relationship. Everyone has heard it said that God wants to be able to have a relationship with us. There is no truer point in all theology. Indeed, the thrust of God&#x2019;s communication with mankind over the course of history has always been <i>relational</i> and not <i>conceptual</i>. That&#x2019;s why he actually prefers it when we come to have faith in him through prayer, instead of through logical arguments alone. God doesn&#x2019;t just want to satisfy a curiosity we have, he wants to enter into a friendship with us. (7) When we take the initiative by <i>asking</i> him a question, instead of <i>treating him as a question</i>, we have actually entered into a dialogue already&#x2014;whether we know it or not. And dialogue&#x2014;back&#x2013;and&#x2013;forth conversation&#x2014;is the heart and foundation of any relationship.<br><br>Now, we couldn&#x2019;t very well have a relationship with God if the communication was all one way. We couldn&#x2019;t hope to make a bit of progress in the spiritual life if God refused to talk back to us when we ask him the simplest question: &#x201c;Are you there?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s why God is always going to answer this question when we pray to him.<br><br>How, exactly, will he do that?<br><br>Before I attempt to answer that, let me first tell you what he is <i>not</i> going to do. If you ask God to show you that he exists, he is not going to hit you over the head with a hammer. He is not going to suddenly appear before your eyes in bodily form. He&#x2019;s not going to perform some tremendous miracle for you. Of course, he can if he wants. He has that option. And he has done that at various times in history with various people, but it&#x2019;s very rare. Chances are he&#x2019;s not going to do it in your case.<br><br>And believe me, you don&#x2019;t want him to! I know that it&#x2019;s very tempting to ask God to show you he exists by performing some miracle for you. But that&#x2019;s the <i>last</i> thing you want him to do. Why? Perhaps you remember the saying &#x201c;To whom much is given, much will be expected&#x201d;? (8) That rule applies here. Let me explain.<br><br>Having to believe in a God you can&#x2019;t see is one of the &#x201c;tests&#x201d; God gives us in this life. And while it&#x2019;s not always the easiest test in the world, it is certainly a test we can all pass. I remember playing a game with my friends when I was a boy in which we had to close our eyes and fall backward into the hands of another boy standing behind us. It was basically a game of trust. You had to believe that your friend was going to catch you. If he didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;if he wanted to play a nasty, cruel joke on you&#x2014;he could actually let you fall and hit the ground. The idea, of course, was that your friend would never do something like that to you. But you still had to trust him, because he could let you fall if he wanted. You were putting yourself in his hands. It wasn&#x2019;t a big risk you were taking, but it was still a scary feeling to be falling backward with your eyes closed and your arms folded in front of you.<br><br>This is similar to the kind of faith test God gives us in life. By being invisible, he is essentially asking us to close our eyes as we fall back. He is asking us to <i>trust</i> him. Now, we can pass the test by believing in him; we can fail it by becoming hardened atheists; or, in rare circumstances, we can have the test taken away from us completely. How so?<br><br>If God wishes to, he can always perform a great miracle for us or show us some kind of vision. If he were to do that, we would no longer need to believe in something we couldn&#x2019;t see. We&#x2019;d have demonstrative, &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; evidence instead. And that&#x2019;s exactly what some people ask God to do. They want a miracle. They want to hear the voice of God announcing his presence in a silent room. They want to see an angel appear before their eyes. They want a chair or a desk to move by itself across the floor. They don't want to close their eyes as they fall back into God's hands. They don&#x2019;t want to trust God.<br><br>But this is where we really have to be careful. Because if God takes away the test of faith from you, he's going to put another test in its place. And you can be sure that this other test won&#x2019;t be easy.<br><br>You see, the overwhelming majority of mankind has to go through life having faith in an invisible God. (9) If you, by some incredible act of God&#x2019;s mercy, are excused from that obligation, you can be certain that you will be expected to perform some pretty incredible feat later on, including even the possibility of giving your life.<br><br>Remember what happened to Moses? He was given the privilege of seeing the finger of God write the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. But then he had to lead a life of hardship and sacrifice in the desert for fifty years and was denied access to the Promised Land. Similarly, Jesus&#x2019; apostles were given the honor of seeing the Lord perform many wondrous miracles before and after his Resurrection&#x2014;but all of them had to die horrible martyrs&#x2019; deaths at the hands of the Romans. (All except John, who was not killed but instead tortured by being dipped into a vat of boiling oil.) Saint Paul was struck blind on the road to Damascus and actually heard God&#x2019;s voice speak to him&#x2014;but after that he had to suffer greatly, was scourged countless times, shipwrecked twice, and finally beheaded in Rome. (10)<br><br>The pages of the Bible and the history of God&#x2019;s church on earth are filled with examples just like these. Like it or not, these are the kinds of tests God offers as <i>substitutions</i> for the faith test. Is that something you really want to chance?<br><br>I&#x2019;m not implying that miracles are &#x201c;bad&#x201d; or that asking God to perform a miracle for you is wrong. Miracles happen every day. When you are confronted with a problem you can&#x2019;t solve, it&#x2019;s only natural to ask God to intervene on your behalf in a supernatural manner. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that. What I&#x2019;m talking about here are those miracles that are so clear, powerful, and indisputable that they essentially render &#x201c;faith&#x201d; in God unnecessary and superfluous. If you ask for that kind of miracle and actually receive one, watch out!<br><br>On the other hand, if you simply ask God to show you that he exists, without all the lightning and thunder, you can expect to be answered just as clearly but without the requisite heroic sacrifice. How so?<br><br>Very simply, God will give you a <i>sign</i> of his presence&#x2014;a real, genuine, bona fide sign. The exact nature of this sign will be up to him, of course. We always have to remember that God is sovereign and can do anything he likes. But you can be sure it will be something out of the ordinary. Something that&#x2014;to you, at least&#x2014;will border on the supernatural. It might be something &#x201c;big&#x201d; or something small; dramatic or quiet; profound or simple. It might come to you through the conversation of a friend or while you are at a church service. It might even come to you while you&#x2019;re at a baseball game! God speaks to different people in different ways and at different times.</p><h2>Phidal - Disney Minnie My First Puzzle Book - Puzzles for Kids and Children Learning Fun</h2><p>Join Minnie, Daisy, Mickey and friends in this fun-filled storybook!

Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection shouldn&#x2019;t have worked, according to the prevailing beliefs of his time. Lord Kelvin gravely miscalculated the age of the earth. Linus Pauling, the world&#x2019;s premier chemist, constructed an erroneous model for DNA in his haste to beat the competition to publication. Astrophysicist Fred Hoyle dismissed the idea of a &#x201c;Big Bang&#x201d; origin to the universe (ironically, the caustic name he gave to this event endured long after his erroneous objections were disproven). And Albert Einstein speculated incorrectly about the forces of the universe&#x2014;and that speculation opened the door to brilliant conceptual leaps. As Mario Livio luminously explains in this &#x201c;thoughtful meditation on the course of science itself&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), these five scientists expanded our knowledge of life on earth, the evolution of the earth, and the evolution of the universe, despite and because of their errors.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thoughtful, well-researched, and beautifully written&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>), <i>Brilliant Blunders </i>is a wonderfully insightful examination of the psychology of five fascinating scientists&#x2014;and the mistakes as well as the achievements that made them famous.</p><p>Mario Livio is an internationally known astrophysicist, a bestselling author, and a popular speaker who has appeared on&nbsp;<i>The Daily Show</i>,&nbsp;<i>60 Minutes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>NOVA</i>.

He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Brilliant Blunders PREFACE<p></p> <br><br> <br>Throughout the entire period that I have been working on this book, every few weeks someone would ask me what my book was about. I developed a standard answer: &#x201c;It is about blunders, and it is not an autobiography!&#x201d; This would get a few laughs and the occasional approbation &#x201c;What an interesting idea.&#x201d; My objective was simple: to correct the impression that scientific breakthroughs are purely success stories. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is the road to triumph paved with blunders, but the bigger the prize, the bigger the potential blunder.<br> <br>Immanuel Kant, the great German philosopher, wrote famously, &#x201c;Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.&#x201d; In the time that has passed since the publication of his The Critique of Practical Reason (1788), we have made impressive progress in understanding the former; considerably less so, in my humble opinion, in elucidating the latter. It is apparently much more difficult to make life or mind comprehensible to itself. Nevertheless, the life sciences in general&#x2014;and the research into the operation of the human brain in particular&#x2014;are truly picking up speed. So it may not be altogether inconceivable after all that one day we will even fully understand why evolution has concocted a sentient species.<br> <br>While this book is about some of the remarkable endeavors to figure out life and the cosmos, it is more concerned with the journey than with the destination.

Doctors Michael R. and Mary Dan Eades make a persuasive case in favor of "the diet we were meant to eat."<p> Similar to Dr. Robert Atkins's <i>New Diet Revolution</i>, the authors cite insulin as the main culprit in weight gain and expound the benefits of a diet extremely low in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, which are changed into sugar during digestion, stimulate the body to store fat, making weight loss virtually impossible. The most revolutionary idea put forth in <i>Protein Power</i> is that the fat you eat has very little bearing on the fat you gain: in other words, we aren't what we eat after all. Researchers have found that eating larger portions of protein in conjunction with severely reduced portions of carbohydrates causes people to burn the excess fat stored in their bodies.</p><p> <i>Protein Power</i> is packed with helpful charts and formulas, so you can estimate your body-fat percentage and your ideal weight for your particular body composition. There are worksheets to calculate your protein need and carbohydrate and protein equivalency charts, as well as charts that allow you to track your fat and weight loss. But this book is not all grams and percentages: it also shows you what a day of eating on this diet would look like and includes sample menus and 70 pages of recipes.

It was such a beautiful day in Montana's gorgeous Bitterroot Valley that he rolled down the front windows to enjoy the afternoon breeze, redolent with the scent of pine. He released a deep breath and tried to toss aside his worries.<br><br> West of the four-lane thoroughfare, the Bitterroot Mountains rose with splendid majesty to the clear blue sky, their glacier-chiseled canyons inviting the eye to delve deeper into the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness. Cam, with a professional background in both fish and game biology, knew a totally different world existed in that remote area, a place so rugged and wild that some people couldn't comprehend it. He kept a close eye on the traffic as he took in the magnificent scenery with quick glances. Someday soon he hoped to have the time to take his son on a hike into those canyons.<br><br> His tight grip on the steering wheel relaxed. The tension eased from his neck and shoulders. Then he noticed that a light dusting of snow capped the mountain peaks. Only a little, he reassured himself. Only a freak dusting. But it was still a warning that those locals who were predicting an early winter might be right. Damn. Isn't it just my luck? If winter strikes sooner than anticipated, my mother will have difficulty navigating our camp.<br><br> Upset, tired, and hungry, Cam bypassed the turn that led to his new hometown, Rustlers' Gulch, and drove farther south to a place called the Cowboy Tree. A bar-and-eatery combo with rustic decor, it offered only limited menu choices, but the food was tasty and easy on the wallet. After parking in the long rectangular lot, Cam checked his reflection in the rearview mirror to fingercomb his hair. Tiny lines had appeared at the corners of his blue eyes. He was only thirty-five, but it had been a stressful summer, and all the worry had taken its toll.<br><br> As he pushed through the double doors of the establishment, he felt the casual, welcoming atmosphere surround him. The walls had been papered here and there with dollar bills autographed by customers. Bistro-height tables, handmade from knotty pine and rectangular in shape, flanked the front windows, while regular tables out of the same wood peppered the inner section of the dining room. A bank of poker machines cozied up to a jukebox at one side. Lighted beer signs offset the darkness of aged wood paneling. Three televisions, kept at a low volume, entertained those interested in sports or a news channel.<br><br> Though the establishment was busier than usual at this time of day, Cam found an empty place near a window and swung up onto a stool, allowing the hum of conversation behind him to become white noise. A little girl with golden curls wandered over and said hi. He guessed her to be about three, and she was adorable. Cam returned the greeting and watched her toddle back to her parents' table.<br><br> At first it had surprised Cam to see minors in places that served hard liquor. Now he took it in stride. Kids weren't allowed to sit at the bar, but they were welcome to come in with adults to eat. The state of Montana apparently believed it was up to parents to decide if a place of business provided an appropriate environment for their children.<br><br> Long ago, the Cowboy Tree had been constructed around a ponderosa pine that had developed an impressive circumference over the years, necessitating periodic enlargements of the hole in the roof that accommodated the conifer's massive trunk. Back in his home state of California, Cam had seen trees inside structures, but for some reason they had never seemed so impressive. This pine and the old building appeared to have sprung up from the earth together. The framed hole in the ceiling allowed precipitation to seep in and collect in the massive rock planter at the base. Staff and patrons added water regularly to keep the roots well hydrated, and Cam believed that water had also been plumbed in under the building.<br><br> "Hi, Cam!" Trish, an attractive bartender with curly, shoulder-length red hair, flashed a bright smile. "You snuck in on me. Long day?"<br><br> Cam laughed and then groaned. "I showed a ranch north of here. Had breakfast at five and not so much as a sip of water since. The potential buyer wanted to walk the land. It's a twelve-hundred-acre parcel. When I make my first sale, buying a side-by-side will be at the top of my list I can tell you that."<br><br> "What's a side-by-side?"<br><br> "A powerful ATV that seats five. They're built sort of like a golf cart and are awesome for showing property. Not much will slow them down."<br><br> "Ah. I've only ever heard them called mules." Trish chuckled. "So thirst and hunger drove you here. I can't imagine trying to walk every inch of that much land. Sounds to me like you should carry a cooler filled with sandwiches and drinks." She circled the bar to serve him a tall glass of water. "The chicken wings are on special, fifty cents apiece, minimum order of five."<br><br> Cam thanked her for the drink. "I'll take ten with the apple-cherry glaze. That should hold me until I get supper on the table tonight."<br><br> "Your mom still on deadline?" Trish asked.<br><br> "Oh, yeah." Cam's mother, Madeline McLendon, was a murder mystery writer of some acclaim. "She'll be too busy killing someone this evening to help me cook. She's always there for cleanup, though."<br><br> Trish took a seat across from him. Her green eyes sparkled with amusement. "I finally found time to read one of her books-her most recent, I think, Death by Potato Sprouts. Do you ever worry when she makes you a fruit smoothie that you might not live to drink all of it?"<br><br> Cam burst out laughing.<br><br> Trish left to place his order, then reappeared behind the bar and held up an empty tumbler. "One for the road?"<br><br> "Only one. Make it my usual, please." Cam stood and took his glass of water to the bar, where he could chat with Trish while he ate. Normally a serving of wings arrived quickly, but the cook seemed to be taking his time today. Trish soon grew busy busing tables. One of her helpers, a thin blonde everyone called Cowgirl, refilled Cam's water glass. "How's your day going?" he asked.<br><br> "Good," she said without enthusiasm. Cam could tell she hated being there and wondered why she stayed on. Maybe she couldn't find other work. "Not much news to report. Same-old, same-old."<br><br> Trish returned, and Cam was glad to see her. At least she knew how to carry on a casual conversation. "I think the cook must have driven to Missoula for more wings," she teased. She made Cam's drink, a dash of Apple Crown over ice, and slid it across the counter to him. Then she held up a leather dice cup. "Want to try your luck while you're waiting?"<br><br> The Cowboy Tree ran daily dice games, the details scrawled on a white dry-erase board. The jackpots were often handsome, sometimes as much as a thousand dollars. Cam had won eight hundred one night when his mom had visited Montana to see their land before they purchased it. He'd never thrown a good roll since.<br><br> "Nah. I think Mom's my lucky charm. I'll bring her back in for dinner some night and try a few rolls then."<br><br> Trish shook the dice, and her cheek dimpled with a saucy grin. "I have a feeling it's your day to win. Roll a full house, and you'll have eight big ones in your pocket."<br><br> Cam shrugged, slapped a five-dollar bill on the counter, and stood up. It was only a few bucks, and he rarely gambled. Why not? He took the cup, gave it a shake, and slapped the mouth down on the counter so the dice wouldn't go every which way.<br><br> "Oh, my God!" Trish cried in a hushed voice. Then she yelled, "He won. First roll, five of a kind! A thousand bucks, people!"<br><br> Cam had four more tries to go. He sensed a crowd gathering behind him. Then, from the corner of his eye, he glimpsed a woman next to him. When he glanced down at her, he felt as if every brain cell he possessed went AWOL. She was beautiful, not the dolled-up kind of beautiful, but naturally lovely. Her straight black hair fell over her slender shoulders like shimmering silk. As far as he could detect, she wore no cosmetics, but that didn't detract from her features, which were delicately molded and enhanced her large dark blue eyes, outlined in long sooty lashes untouched by mascara.<br><br> She arched an eyebrow. "Aren't you going to roll again?"<br><br> Cam realized that he held the cup frozen at shoulder height. "Sure," he found the presence of mind to say. "You just took the wind out of my sails."<br><br> "That's a line that's seen its day," she said with a laugh. "Roll hot, cowboy. I like winners."<br><br> Cam shook the dice, and one die shot off the counter. He winced as Trish picked it up, wondering what the hell had gotten into him. He wasn't a hormone-driven teenager.<br><br> "Free roll," Trish said.<br><br> Cam took another turn. Trish shrieked. When Cam focused, he saw that he'd rolled another five of a kind. He tossed the dice three more times and got zip. After Trish counted his winnings onto the bar, he plucked one bill from the pile and handed it to her.<br><br> "You don't have to do that, Cam. A hundred bucks? No way."<br><br> "Hey, you're the one who convinced me it might be my lucky day."<br><br> As Cam collected his money, the other woman shifted closer and asked, "Would you like to join me at my table?"<br><br> Cam swept his gaze downward from her remarkable face to take in the rest of her. She wore a fitted plaid Western shirt that had endured some wear, faded Wrangler jeans, and scuffed riding boots, the toe of one sporting a piece of hay. He also caught the familiar scent of horses mingling faintly with her perfume. He grabbed his drink. Just my kind of gal, he thought. Maybe it really is my lucky day.<br><br> As Kirstin Conacher led the way to her table, she was acutely aware of the man behind her. He�d caught her attention the moment he entered the building-muscular, six feet of handsome, with tousled hair that gleamed like the well-varnished knotty pine bar. His eyes were a radiant sky blue, and he had a burnished tone to his skin that pegged him as an outdoor enthusiast. She could tell with only a look that he was no stranger to physical labor, and she�d been impressed by the easy, warm way he conversed with Trish. No fake charm, no canned lines. She found the sense of authenticity that he gave off very refreshing. There was also something vaguely familiar about him, but she couldn�t recall ever having met him.<br><br> Oh, Kirstin, she mentally scolded herself, what on earth were you thinking to hit on him like that? Her cheeks burned with embarrassment. So what if she'd been searching for the right guy for six years and could hear her biological clock ticking? That was no excuse for her to be so forward. Normally she waited for a man to hit on her, not the other way around.<br><br> She resumed her seat, where a martini, extra dirty and straight up, still awaited her. In Kirstin's opinion, Trish made the best one in the valley. Only she hadn't come here for an afternoon drink. The martini was merely one of her stage props. She'd learned over time that men in bars tended to steer clear of a lone woman having a soda. A recognizable mixed drink seemed to spur on conversation.<br><br> Cam took a stool across from her. "Have you already ordered?"<br><br> She met his gaze, and a tingling sensation moved up her spine. That surprised her. She'd met dozens of handsome men, but she'd never felt like this. "Yes. The cook seems to be dragging his feet today."<br><br> "Come here often?"<br><br> "Not that often." Liar, liar, boots on fire. She came to the Cowboy Tree as often as she was able to escape from her dad's ranch for a couple of hours. The male patrons tended to be landowners who put in an honest day's work. She knew most of them, and unfortunately, they also knew her. Local men didn't mess with Sam Conacher's daughter. She kept hoping for a stranger to drop in, someone wonderful who wouldn't know about her dad. "Are you new to the valley?"<br><br> "Oh, yeah." He flashed a dazzling grin that creased his lean cheeks and displayed straight white teeth. "Anyone whose family hasn't been in the valley for three generations is a newcomer, or so I'm told. It'll be years before I earn the privilege of being recognized as a Bitterrooter."<br><br> She bent her head and toyed with her olive pick. Her cheeks went warm again. When she looked up, she said, "I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression. I don't habitually hit on guys."<br><br> A twinkle danced in his eyes. "Did you hit on me? It went over my head. I guess I need to get out more."<br><br> "My name's Kirstin."<br><br> "Cam."<br><br> "I know. I heard Trish talking with you after you came in. Short for Cameron?"<br><br> "Yep. Cameron McLendon."<br><br> Her fingers tightened on the olive pick. "Scottish?"<br><br> "Only half. My mom's Irish."<br><br> Kirstin's father was a Scot, and he was the most stubborn, irascible man she'd ever known. He hadn't always been that way, though. The death of her mother six years earlier had changed him. "Well, half Scottish or not, you seem nice."<br><br> He chuckled. "I take it you have a low opinion of Scots."<br><br> "Not really. Just a difficult experience with one in particular." She took a sip of her drink. "So, Cameron McLendon, tell me about yourself."<br><br> He smiled. "Boring story."<br><br> "So is mine, I'm afraid, but to get acquainted, we have to start somewhere, and I asked first."<br><br> He chuckled. "Want me to get two toothpicks so you can prop your eyelids open?" He followed the question with a sigh. "Okay, here goes. I got a job opportunity with Long Barrel Ranches, and I've wanted to live here or in northern Idaho most of my adult life. It was finally my chance to chase my dreams, so I took the position."<br><br> "I'm not bored yet. Keep talking."<br><br> He shrugged. "For a long time, my dreams took second seat to my responsibilities, and I got stuck in Northern California. It's not that I dislike California, but after a couple of trips to this area, I fell in love. I kept hoping I might settle here, but life kept throwing me curveballs."</p><h2>Learning from the Giants: Life and Leadership Lessons from the Bible (Giants of the Bible)</h2><p>If you could spend a few minutes with the giants of faith in the Old Testament in person, what lessons would they share with you?

Jessie lives in New York City.Stanley has been delighting and informing readers with her biographies for years, and here, her considerable talents are once again on display. . . .

This is a solid addition to STEM studies, yes, but, also a great choice for any biography lovers. -- Booklist, STARRED REVIEW<br><br>Complementing the clear prose, Hartland's whimsical gouache pictures portray white figures with coral lips and in period dress. Gestural brushstrokes loosely evoke landscapes and interiors, yet scores of objects&#x2014;from book titles and period toys to an omnipresent cat&#x2014;provide plentiful visual interest. Pithy narrative plus charming pictures equals an admiring, admirable portrait of a STEM pioneer. -- Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Stanley delivers a breezy but insightful overview of the curiosity and determination that drove Ada Lovelace (1815&#x2013;1852) to pursue her intellectual passions, tracing her childhood dreams of flight, her friendship and working relationship with Charles Babbage, and her pioneering programming work in service of promoting Babbage&#x2019;s Analytical Machine. Hartland keeps the mood light in loopy gouache cartoons that humorously portray Lovelace as the creative and intelligent product of parents &#x201c;as different as chalk and cheese&#x201d;; in facing family portraits, the &#x201c;rational, respectable, and strict&#x201d; Lady Byron stares uncomfortably at her husband, Lord Byron, who looks rakish in multiple senses of the word.

I certainly don't claim to know all the answers. I'm barely figuring out the questions...Life has a strange way of repeating itself and I want my experience to help you...My hope is that you'll consider my words and remember my heart.</i> <br> Harry Whitney is dying. He has Alzheimer's disease, and he knows his "good" time is dwindling. So he compiles a book of poems for his favorite granddaughter, Emily, hoping that his words of hard-won wisdom will heal the old wounds that are tearing his family apart. But Harry's poems contain much more than meets the eye -- clues and riddles that lead to an extraordinary cache of letters and a promise of hidden gold. As Emily and her family uncover Harry's secrets one by one, they learn unforgettable lessons about romance, forgiveness and hope that might hold them all together.</p><p><b>Camron Wright</b> is a graduate of Brigham Young University. <i>Letters for Emily,</i> his first novel, was inspired by the writings of his late grandfather. He lives with his family near Salt Lake City. Visit his website at www.lettersforemily.com.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> My bed is frigid and the room dark. I've placed many blankets on my bed, but they don't stop the cold Wasatch wind that penetrates to my bones. I stare through the window at my snow-covered plants and realize I will miss my garden. I will miss the way the carrots emerge from seeds not much bigger than dust. I will miss thinning beets in the late spring. I will miss digging for new potatoes in the fall. I will miss harvesting buckets of zucchini for unsuspecting neighbors who will then have no idea what to do with them; and I will even miss watching the plants turn brown and die each year as winter sets in. </p><p> My garden has taught me that every living thing must die. I have watched it happen now for scores of years -- I only wish I could have a few more summers in my garden with Emily. </p><p> I have other grandchildren, and I don't mean to play favorites, but the others live far away and seldom visit. Emily visits with her mother every Friday. Though our ages are more than seven decades apart, Emily and I are best friends. </p><p> My name is Harry, a laughable name for a man who's been completely bald most of his life. But, hairy or not, it's my name nonetheless. It was my father's name before me, and his father's before him. I wish I could say it was a name I passed on to my own son. I can't. When he was born and it came time to give him a name, we chose Bob instead. He rarely visits; he never writes. Now, on occasion, I wish I'd named him Harry as well. </p><p> Strangely, I'm not bitter about what is happening to me. Why should I be? I am no better than anyone else. I am no wiser, no stronger, and no smarter. (Okay, I am smarter than ol' man Ross who lives next door but that's beside the point.) So then, why not me? </p><p> I hope to go quickly so I'll be remembered as Grandpa Harry and not as the person I'm becoming. I fear I'll be remembered as a contemptible, cranky old man and that thought sickens me. The fact is, I'm losing my mind. I have Alzheimer's -- an insidious disease that causes the nerve cells in the brain to degenerate. As it works its havoc, the brain shrinks and wastes away -- dementia sets in, causing disorientation and confusion. There is no cure, no way to slow its determined progression. </p><p> This disease is a thief. It begins with short spells of forgetfulness, but before it's finished, it steals everything. It takes your favorite color, the smell of your favorite food, the night of your first kiss, your love of golf. Droplets of shimmering water cleansing the earth during an invigorating spring shower simply become rain. Mammoth snowflakes blanketing the ground in white at the onset of winter's first storm merely seem cold. Your heart beats, your lungs suck in air, your eyes see images, but inside you are dead. Inside your spirit is gone. I say it is an insidious disease because in the end, it steals your existence -- even your very soul. In the end I will forget Emily. </p><p> The disease is progressing, and even now people are beginning to laugh. I do not hate them for it; they laugh with good reason. I would laugh as well at the stupid things I do. Two days ago I peed in the driveway in my front yard. I had to go and at the time it seemed like a great spot. A week before, I woke up in the middle of the night, walked into the kitchen, and tried to gargle with the dishwashing liquid that is kept in the cupboard beneath the sink. I thought I was in the bathroom, and the green liquid was the same color as my mouthwash. I get nervous. I get scared, and I cry; I cry like a baby over the most ridiculous things. During my life, I've seldom cried. </p><p> There are times when I can still think clearly, but each day I feel my good time fading -- my existence getting shorter. During my good spells, now just an hour or two a day, I sit at my desk and I write. I crouch over the keyboard on my computer and I punch the keys wildly. It's an older computer, but it serves its purpose well. It's the best gift Bob has given me in years. It's an amazing machine and every time I use it, I marvel at how it captures my words. Younger people who have grown up with computers around them don't appreciate the truly miraculous machines they are. They create magic. </p><p> I'm not a good writer, but I've loved writing stories and poems all of my life. Writing always made me feel immortal -- as if I were creating an extension of my life that nothing could destroy. It was exhilarating. </p><p> I no longer write for excitement. There are times when my back aches and my eyes blur, and I can't get my fingers to hit the right keys, but I continue. I write now for Emily. She is just seven years old. I doubt she'll remember my face; I doubt she'll remember the crooked fingers on my wrinkled hands or the age spots on my skin or my shiny, bald head. But hopefully, by some miracle, she will read my stories and my poems and she'll remember my heart, and consider me as her friend. That is my deepest desire. </p><p> At times I feel bad that I'm not writing to my other grandchildren, but I hardly know them. While they visit every Christmas, they don't stay long. They are courteous, but they treat me like a stranger. It's not their fault. I'm not angry with them, and I hope they aren't angry with me. </p><p> My worst fear is that before I finish, I will slip completely into the grasp of the terrible monster, never to return. If this happens, my prayer would be that those around me might forget -- but they will not forget -- and then, worse than being forgotten, I will be remembered as a different person than I truly am. I will be despised. </p><p> I vow not to let this happen, so during my good times, I write -- I write for Emily. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2001 by Camron Wright</p></p><h2>Do Not Disturb</h2><p><b>Equal parts <i>Dexter</i> and <i>50 Shades</i>, this is the eagerly awaited follow-up to the award winning erotic thriller, <i>The Girl in 6E, </i>by A.R.

In <i>Love from Heaven</i>, she reveals for the first time that she sees love as a physical force.<br> <br> Lorna first became conscious that the angels were teaching her about love when she was five years old, and today she can see how love manifests in each of us. She sees that newborn babies are full of pure love and that many teenagers and adults seem surrounded at the heart level by a transparent but ironlike band, which restricts that love.<br> <br> We are all pure love, but nine out of ten of us have locked away most of this love within ourselves. This love remains there, though&#x2014;indestructible and ready to be released, if only we can learn to love ourselves first.<br> <br> <i>Love from Heaven </i>will transform the way you think about love, stir up the love within, and make you more compassionate, leading to a happier life for you and those around you.</p><p>Born in Ireland,&nbsp;Lorna Byrne&nbsp;is the author of international bestsellers&nbsp;<i>A</i>&nbsp;<i>Message of Hope from the Angels</i>&nbsp;and her autobiography&nbsp;<i>Angels in My Hair,</i>&nbsp;which has been translated into twenty-six languages and sold in more than fifty countries.

But most of us have locked away this love within ourselves and don&#x2019;t let it out. This love remains there, though. We can lock love away but we cannot destroy it, and we always have the potential to release it. We release it first by learning to love ourselves again. If we are unable to love ourselves, we are unable to love another.<br> <br>Love is the most powerful force in the world; it comes from our soul, it comes from heaven. It&#x2019;s love that brings all the joy and happiness into our lives; it&#x2019;s love that helps to steer us in the right direction and drives us forward, regardless of what is going on in our lives; it&#x2019;s love that makes living worthwhile.<br> <br>Love is like the sun; it&#x2019;s our life force, it transcends everything. And yet the angels keep showing me how little love most people feel for themselves and, as a result, how little love there really is in our lives&#x2014;and how much more there could be. The state of our world today is evidence of this absence of love.<br> <br>People often think that love should be all sweetness and light&#x2014;but the truth is, love frequently hurts. When we open ourselves to love, we also open ourselves up to being hurt. So many of us have learned from the time we are children to harden ourselves, to lock away our love for fear of being hurt. In locking away this love we make ourselves and our world much more coldhearted, selfish, and sadder. In locking love away deep within us, we diminish our humanity.<br> <br>Ever since I was a young child, the angels have been teaching me about love and helping me to see the force of love physically.<br> <br>I see angels all the time. I cannot remember any time when I have not seen them. From the moment I opened my eyes after I was born they were there&#x2014;even though I did not know they were angels. I see them physically as clearly as I see my daughter sitting across the dinner table. There has never been a day when I haven&#x2019;t seen angels. Angels are my best friends, my companions, and my teachers.<br> <br>The first time I was conscious of the angels teaching me about love was when I was about five years old. I was sitting at the kitchen table at home in Old Kilmainham, Dublin, with my mum and da, and my sisters. There was a visitor there, and this person had brought a wonderful treat: a chocolate cake. We children were so excited, as my parents could rarely afford to buy a cake. The table was surrounded by angels. One of the angels told me to watch my father carefully. I did as I was told. As I looked, I started to notice what appeared to be a soft mist coming gently from my father. It seemed to come from every pore of his being, from his whole body, and moved in the direction of my mother. I looked over at Mum and realized that there was a similar mist coming from her. The two mists touched and intertwined. The mist had no color, but sparkled in the way ice would in the sunshine.<br> <br>This was the first time I was aware of physically seeing the force of love, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have seen it without the angels&#x2019; help.<br> <br>My da was cutting the cake and started to serve me first but my mum stopped him, saying sharply that my sister should get the first slice. My da looked up as if stung and the mist seemed to pull back toward him. The love force I had seen between them had disappeared. The angels told me that my mum&#x2019;s angry comment had made him pull back his love and lock it away. Da was hurt and confused because he hadn&#x2019;t consciously chosen one child over another; he was serving me because I was nearer to him than my sister.<br> <br>This was to be the first of many times I would see this love force. I see it when someone is thinking loving thoughts about someone or something. I don&#x2019;t see it with everyone or all the time. To be honest, I don&#x2019;t see it in the abundance I would like. I probably see it with one out of every twenty people I come across on a normal day.<br> <br>I am still struggling to describe further what this love force looks like. It&#x2019;s not a bit like an aura or energy, or a ray of light. It&#x2019;s sometimes completely different, yet quite visible to me.<br> <br>The angels haven&#x2019;t just taught me to see the force of love, they have also taught me to see and measure its intensity&#x2014;like different temperatures.<br> <br>Love is the most powerful force in the world.<br> <br>Angels have taught me everything I know. Angel Michael and Angel Hosus are probably the angels who have taught me the most&#x2014;apart from my guardian angel, whom I am not allowed to talk about. I first met Angel Michael when I was a very young child. He almost always gives me the appearance of a handsome man. I first met Angel Hosus around the time that I first saw the physical force of love. He gives the appearance of an old-fashioned schoolteacher with a gown and a funny-shaped hat. He is full of knowledge and wisdom and is great at cheering me up and giving me confidence. He started all those years ago in school when I struggled because of my dyslexia and felt very stupid, and he helps me now when I&#x2019;m writing and doing interviews.<br> <br>There is another angel whose name I don&#x2019;t know, who I have never even seen properly who is there to teach me about love. This angel was there in the kitchen when I saw the love between my mother and father, and is here with me now as I write about the love force. The angel always seems to be to my right, slightly behind me and out of my line of vision; it&#x2019;s as if I am not allowed to see any more of it. I have no idea why. I have asked about this angel but been told no more about it. I think of it as a special type of teacher-angel sent to help me understand more about love so that I can share it with you.<br> <br>After the angel with no name had shown me how to physically see the force of love, it started teaching me to measure its intensity. As I was only six or seven at the time, this angel taught me using my fingers. When it wanted to indicate that what I was seeing was love force of an intensity of three, it would bend down two fingers on my hand, to leave three fingers up. It stood behind me doing this, and whenever I tried to turn around to look at the angel I seemed to be physically incapable of doing so, as if some force was stopping me.<br> <br>If I had learned to measure love force as an adult, I think the angel might have taught me differently. But this is the way I learned it, so this is how I still measure the intensity of love today.<br> <br>Most love that I see I measure as being between one and ten, but occasionally I have the privilege of being shown love that is completely off this scale; I think of it as one hundred. This number&#x2014;one hundred&#x2014;was the biggest number I could comprehend as a child when the angel with no name was teaching me about this.<br> <br>An intensity of love of one hundred is so beautiful to see. It reflects the purity of the love coming from the person. It&#x2019;s so hard to describe, though; it&#x2019;s crystal clear and full of a warm light and the force of love shines all around the person and from them.<br> <br>It gives me enormous joy when I see love of this intensity. It overwhelms me emotionally and leaves me hardly able to speak. It touches me deeply and stirs up the love within myself. I can feel the effects of it weeks later.<br> <br>I have no way of knowing whether I feel the force of love differently from others. The angels have told me that everyone has the potential to feel love. It may be, though, that because the angels have made me very conscious of love, and have taught me how to see it physically, that I am more sensitive to feeling it than others.<br> <br>The angels have also told me that God has allowed me to see the force of love so that I can help to stir up the love that is within all of us.<br> <br>We are all born pure love. As a baby in our mother&#x2019;s womb, we all love unconditionally. Every one of us, regardless of whether we are wanted, or whether our mums have an easy pregnancy or labor, glow with pure love when we are born. As newborns, we know we are perfect and deserving of love and feel pure love for ourselves and everyone around us.<br> <br>Almost immediately, though, this love force begins to diminish. Even with the most loving mother and father, the baby starts to feel the coldness and lack of love in our world and starts to protect itself by locking away this love inside itself.<br> <br>The angel with no name taught me to see what it looks like physically when we lock our love away. I was about eight when I was taught this. We were living in our cousin&#x2019;s house in Ballymun after the roof of our house in Old Kilmainham had collapsed. It was a beautiful spring day and I was walking back alone from the shops, having bought some milk for my mother. The angel with no name appeared beside me. There was a group of young boys playing on the street and the angel pointed out a scrawny boy of about five in shorts with a shirt hanging out and told me to look at him carefully. As I did, the boy turned to look in my direction. The angel allowed me to see what looked like a band around the boy&#x2019;s body at heart level. It&#x2019;s hard to describe; it was transparent, like a sheet of ice.<br> <br>It was as if the love inside him was locked away so that he was not open to being hurt again. The angel asked me if I could feel anything. I could feel the boy&#x2019;s hurt and pain, and I could also feel the love that wasn&#x2019;t being allowed out. It tore me apart.<br> <br>I wanted to give him a hug; I walked toward him and, as I got closer, I could see tears in his eyes. I said hello and reached out to him, but as I did he turned away.<br> <br>The angel told me that he had locked away his love and was afraid of my affection, or anyone else&#x2019;s. I was sorry I had no sweets in my pocket that I could give him. I asked the angel, in the way an eight-year-old would, whether a sweet would help. I couldn&#x2019;t see the angel&#x2019;s face, but I felt as if it was smiling as it replied that kindness, a loving gesture, from a stranger, or from anyone, could help him to unlock some of this love.<br> <br>Sometimes unconsciously we unlock some of our love. When we hear of a tragedy in another part of the world we may be engulfed by a feeling of enormous sadness and compassion. We don&#x2019;t know the people affected, but we feel for them. We are touched. The love within us is stirred up and we allow some of it out.<br> <br>I remember coming across a woman on the street just after the news broke of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. I hadn&#x2019;t yet heard about the disaster so I was astonished by the strength of the love I was seeing coming from her, and I didn&#x2019;t know what had caused it. It was like a whirlwind of love coming from every part of her being. It was as if the defenses she had built around herself to protect her from the pain of love had been blown away by the strength of the emotions and love she was feeling.<br> <br>We feel love through our emotions. And emotions stir us up, helping us to release the love inside that we may be trying to keep in check. Many of us do our best to stop love from being stirred up inside us, to stop ourselves from feeling this compassion. We decide that if an event doesn&#x2019;t affect us personally, we shouldn&#x2019;t be moved by it&#x2014;that it doesn&#x2019;t affect our lives. But it does. When we don&#x2019;t let ourselves feel emotions such as compassion and love for our fellow human beings, even strangers, we become less human and this allows emotions such as hate and anger to flourish. We become colder individuals, even to those who we care for.<br> <br>We also forget to care for and love ourselves. The angels tell me that loving ourselves is very important for our happiness. I am shown that most people don&#x2019;t love themselves enough. It&#x2019;s as if we have forgotten the importance of loving ourselves.<br> <br>Again, the angel with no name who has taught me so much about love taught me how to recognize the force of love when it is directed toward loving oneself. To be honest, I didn&#x2019;t often see it in my own immediate family when growing up. The first time I remember seeing it was when I was seven or eight. I remember going to a Christmas party at my granny&#x2019;s house. There were lots of people there. The angel with no name told me to look into the sitting room. My uncle Peter was sitting there perched on the arm of a big comfortable chair. As I watched I could see the force of love emerging from him, coming forward, and then moving back toward him like a wave. I could see it was the love force, the same I had seen between my mum and da, but it was as if he was being showered with the love that was coming from within. He looked so happy in himself, happy just to be.<br> <br>His love for himself was so attractive; I wanted to be with him. At that moment he saw me and called me over. I sat happily on his knee and could see and feel the comfort and consolation of his love for himself. Every so often it would make me giggle, and Uncle Peter would look at me inquisitively as if wondering what this funny little child was thinking.<br> <br>Love, for ourselves or another, helps us connect more deeply with our spirituality, with our soul. If the only thing you take from this book is to learn to love yourself more, it will make a big difference in your life, and the lives of those around you. In the next chapter I&#x2019;m going to tell you a lot more about why this is so important, and how you can love yourself more.<br> <br>Each and every one of us, regardless of religion or beliefs, has a soul. God loves us all so much that he has given each of us a little speck of himself. This speck of the light of God is our soul. We connect more deeply with our soul when we open ourselves up to love.<br> <br>Love is love; it&#x2019;s always the same, but the angel with no name has shown me that many people have a very narrow view of love&#x2014;they simply see it as something between a couple, or within a family. I meet so many people who are crying out for love, but they think the only way to get this love is through a romance, and because of this they are failing to see the love that is already in their lives. They fail to recognize there are many different ways in which we can love.<br> <br>One day, when I was about eleven, I was out in the old coach houses at the back of the big hostel where my granny worked in County Clare. The angel with no name came and told me to follow my granddad quietly so I wouldn&#x2019;t be seen. My granddad was a quiet man who had lost a leg in the fight for Irish independence and, as a result, had difficulty walking. I followed quietly as he walked into one of the sheds and peeked inside. I could see love pouring from my grandfather, even as I saw a look of shock and distress on his face. At the same time I was wondering what was going on.<br> <br>I watched as he took a white handkerchief from his pocket and, with great difficulty, leaned down toward the ground.<br> <br>When I saw what he had picked up I understood what had happened. In the handkerchief were two tiny birds&#x2014;baby swallows. There was a swallows&#x2019; nest high up on the wall and somehow, I have no idea how, these two little birds had fallen out.<br> <br>To see the look of love on my grandfather&#x2019;s face, and the force of love pouring from him toward them, moved me so much. The angel with no name beside me said, &#x201c;This is love. He has locked away so much love because of how hard his life has been.&#x201d; I thought with sadness of his two children who had, I had been told, died tragically and young. &#x201c;This love he feels for these birds is the same as the love you saw your parents show each other. The sadness is that your grandfather finds it easier to...</p><h2>Interceding Christian</h2><p>In this outline Kenneth E.

You can try but you don&#x2019;t just get to get over mental illness at age twenty-five, go to medical school, write a book, get married and call it a wrap.</p> <p>In the seventies I was in so in love with the medical model I almost thought I had invented it. "No shame. No blame." I was thrilled to not have my health be dependent on the sanity of society or the wellness of those around me. I was magnanimous about not wanting to credit insight or hard work or circumstances like the kindness of others. Now, the medical model has morphed into "Shut up and take your pills." What passes for care is medication, medication, and more medication, the purpose of which is only incidentally and occasionally to help the patient get a life.</p> <p>Much of mental illness is genetic, but I&#x2019;m now quite sure there are people with more or less the same genetics I have who never go crazy and others who never get well. As a kid who wrote a little and painted a little and played a little music, I certainly didn&#x2019;t want my mental health riding on anything as flimsy as my creative abilities but, among other things, I&#x2019;ve come to see that a willingness to write, paint and play music is more than a little important to progress and just trying to keep my feet under me.</p> <p>It was the feeling that good things had happened to me in spite of myself, that I had a rich life that showed itself in my house and how I practiced pediatrics and how we lived as a family that made me want to write <i>Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So</i>.

According to James Montgomery Boice, Nehemiah's leadership abilities were born from his submission to God, his ability to focus on the right goals, his wisdom in handling complex situations, and his courage to act decisively. "But the most important thing about Nehemiah," says Boice, "is that he was a man of God, and because he was so close to God in prayer and personal piety, he was able to draw from God the wisdom, patience, skill, and perseverance he needed."<br><br>This insightful commentary follows a chosen leader through the great task of rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem 150 years after it was destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar. Through analysis of eight dynamics of the Old Testament text, Boice explores all aspects of Nehemiah's work, from taking command to getting the work done, from dealing with oppression to dedicating the wall and establishing Jerusalem as a city under God.<br><br>James Montgomery Boice (1938-2000) was senior pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

An indispensable tool for naturalists traveling to Africa, this new edition has been revised to acknowledge the enthusiasm to those watching these magnificent animals at zoos and wildlife parks, and on film.</p> <p><em>The Safari Companion</em> enables readers to recognize and interpret visible behavioral activities, such as courtship rituals, territorial marking, aggression, and care of young. Each account of over 80 species includes a behavioral table in which the unique actions of the hoofed mammals, carnivores, and primates are described for easy reference. In addition, useful maps show the major national boundaries, vegetation zones, and game parks relevant to the guide. The book includes an extensive glossary, as well as tips on wildlife photography, a list of organizations working to protect African wildlife, and advice on where and when to see the animals.<br> </p></p><p>Richard D. Estes has led wildlife-viewing safaris in Africa for many years and is one of the world&#39;s foremost experts on the social ecology of African mammals. Dr. Estes is a Research Associate at the Smithsonian Institution Conservation and Research Center, an Associate at the Harvard Museums of Natural History, and a Trustee of The Rare Species Conservatory Foundation. He lives in Peterborough, New Hampshire.<p><strong><em>Library Journal</em>-</strong><br><br>Anyone who goes on safari will want to make room in his or her suitcase for this treasure. Estes, who is affiliated with the Smithsonian Institute as a research associate, spent over eight years doing fieldwork in Africa and over 17 years leading safaris. His admirable qualifications as an expert on the social ecology of African mammals are reflected in the text, which describes approximately 86 species of African mammals. Introductory chapters give practical advice on how to observe animals, including tips on using binoculars and photographic equipment. Other chapters are arranged by standard taxonomic classification. Estes first covers the characteristics of families and subfamilies and then goes into even more detail on the individual species, charting behaviors one can expect to see and the usual context or meaning. Icons illustrating the behaviors effectively take the reader to a description of the behavior being observed. Appended to the text are a brief suggested reading list, addresses of major wildlife organizations, a glossary of terms, and a thorough index. The only "fault" with this exceptionally well-written and researched book is its size. With a 6 9 trim and some 470 pages of text, this is a fairly large, hefty volume to pack on safari--but it is worth the extra effort, as nothing compares with it. Essential for any traveler to Africa, any student of animals or behavior, any zoo visitor, and any size public library.</p></p><h2>Lectio Divina&#x2015;The Sacred Art: Transforming Words &amp; Images into Heart-Centered Prayer (The Art of Spiritual Living)</h2><p><p><strong>Nurture your inner monk and surrender to the natural grace and rhythm of your heart's deepest longings.</strong></p><blockquote><p>"The whole world is, in fact, a text of sacred revelation.

Highly controversial in his day, and down to the present, Bugnini has attracted high praise from his disciples and vilification from his detractors&#x2014;but all agree that without his energetic organizational skills and access to the levers of power, the most extensive overhaul of the Roman Catholic liturgy in the history of the Church would not have taken place as it did.</p> <p>Yet who was Bugnini, really? What were his formative experiences, personal ideals, intellectual assumptions, practical aims? How did he accomplish so much in so short a time? Why, after such a singular collaboration with Pope Paul VI, did he suddenly fall from grace and suffer exile? Should he be remembered as <i>liturgiae amator et cultor</i>, lover and servant of the liturgy (his epitaph), or as the <i>�minence grise</i> of an unscrupulous reinvention of Catholic worship? Can we cut through the legendary, the polemical, and the partisan, to arrive at a clear portrait of the man and his work? Until now, there has been no biography that makes extensive use of all available documentary sources, including Bugnini&#x2019;s own memoirs, Vatican publications, private correspondence, interviews, articles, and lectures.

In this volume, readers will be inspired by Julian, a celebrated English mystic from the fourteenth century and a recluse at St. Julian s Church in Norwich, whose writings were the first works in English known to be written by a woman.<br>Drawing from her published writings, editor Lisa Dahill here selects forty inspiring passages from Julian's work that help illustrate God's love and compassion for all. A medieval Catholic, Julian was seen as a precursor to Martin Luther and other Reformation writers. Much of what she wrote speaks of the most profound mysteries of the Christian faith, and her Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love (circa 1393) is considered to be one of the most remarkable documents of medieval religious experience. In it she speaks of the great love of God for God s people and how sin stands in the way. It is Jesus, however, who assures her, that all would be well, and all manner of things would be well. <br><br>40-Day Journey with Julian of Norwich begins with a short introduction to the life of Julian and then offers forty chapters, each of which includes a reading from her writings, related Scripture passages, questions to ponder, journal-reflection exercises, and a prayer. The book also includes helps on how to use the book and hints on keeping a journal along with ideas for further reading. Each chapter in the book includes space for notes.</p><p>Lisa E.

The warmth and affection between child and grandparent is evident, but the texts are repetitive and sentimental. These offerings are less successful than Ackerman's Song and Dance Man (Knopf, 1988), Rockwell's When I Go Visiting (Macmillan, 1984), Chorao's Kevin's Grandma (Dutton, 1975), and Schertle's William and Grandpa (Lothrop, 1989). These read-alouds and read-alone favorites feature warm relationships between children and grandparents in addition to strong character development and lively story lines, both of which are lacking in the Hallinan titles. --Janie Schomberg, Univ . of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Your Tarot Court: Read Any Deck With Confidence</h2><p><p><strong>Turn the Tarot Court Cards into Noble Allies for Every Reading You Do</strong></p> <p>Meet the people and personalities of the tarot in a whole new way with <em>Your Tarot Court</em>.

He stayed inside the house tending his orchids, drinking fivequarts of beer a day, and devouring gourmet meals prepared by his live-in chef.So he hired Archie Goodwin to screen clients, run investigative errands, chasedown clues, and drag people back to the brownstone to be rudely interrogated.Archie was an ex-cop or an ex-soldier or something like that, so he was well suitedfor the job.</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes, an eccentric,wound-up, cocaine addict who played his violin all night and conducted chemicalexperiments in his living room. He probably would have been committed if itweren&#x2019;t for Dr. Watson. The doctor retired from the army with a war injury,rented a room from Holmes, and ended up being the detective&#x2019;s assistant andofficial chronicler. His medical degree and experience serving in the war gaveWatson the skills and temperament he needed to deal with Holmes.</p><p>At least I didn&#x2019;t live with Adrian Monk,another brilliant detective, the way Archie and Dr. Watson did with theiremployers, but I&#x2019;d still argue that the job was a lot harder for me than it wasfor them. For one thing, I didn&#x2019;t have any of their qualifications. </p><p>My name is Natalie Teeger.I&#x2019;ve had a lot of odd jobs, but I&#x2019;m not an ex-FBI agent or a promisingcriminology student or an aspiring paramedic, one of which I&#x2019;d be if this werea book or a TV series instead of my life. I was bartending before I met Monk,so I suppose I could have mixed myself a nice, strong drink after work if Iwanted to. But I didn&#x2019;t, because I was also a widowed single mother trying to raisea twelve-year-old daughter, and it&#x2019;s a good idea to do that sober.</p><p>If I&#x2019;d done my research into brilliantdetectives <i>before</i> working for AdrianMonk instead of <i>after</i>, I might nothave taken the job.<br> I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. NeroWolfe and Sherlock Holmes are fictional characters, so what could I possibly learnfrom their assistants? The thing is, I couldn&#x2019;t find any real detectives whowere anything like Monk, and I was desperate for guidance. They were the onlysources of information I could turn to.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s what I learned from them: When itcomes to assisting a great detective, you can be an ex-cop or a doctor or haveother qualifications and it&#x2019;s not going to make a difference. Because whatever makes your boss a genius at solving murders isgoing to make life impossible for everybody around him, especially you.And no matter how hard you try, that&#x2019;s never going to change.</p><p>That&#x2019;s especially true with Adrian Monk, whohas a smorgasbord of obsessive compulsive disorders. You can&#x2019;t truly grasp themagnitude of his anxieties and phobias unless you experience them every singleday like, God help me, I did. </p><p>Everything in his life has to be in order,following some arcane rules that make sense only to Monk. For instance, I&#x2019;veseen him at breakfast remove every bran flake and raisin from a bowl ofKellogg&#x2019;s Raisin Bran and count them to be sure there&#x2019;s afour-flake-to-one-raisin ratio in his bowl before he starts eating. How did hecome up with that ratio? How did he determine that anything else "violated thenatural laws of the universe"? I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to know. </p><p>He&#x2019;s also got a thing about germs, though notto the extent that he won&#x2019;t go outside or interact with people, but he doesn&#x2019;tmake it easy. </p><p>Monk brings his own silverware and dishes to restaurants.He takes a folding lawn chair with him to the movies because he can&#x2019;t bear thethought of sitting in a seat a thousand other people have sat in. When a birdcrapped on my windshield, he called 911. I could go on, but I think you get thepicture.</p><p>Dealing with all of his quirks and acting asthe middleman between him and the civilized world was very stressful stuff. Itwas wearing me down to the point of total exhaustion. So I turned to the booksabout Nero Wolfe and Sherlock Holmes hoping to glean from them some helpfuladvice that might make my job a little easier. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t find any. </p><p>I finally realized that my only hope was toescape, to get far away from Monk. Not forever, because as difficult as he was,I liked him, and the job was flexible enough to allow me to be there for mydaughter. All I really needed were a few peaceful days off to go someplacewhere he couldn&#x2019;t reach me and I could get some rest. The problem was, I couldn&#x2019;t afford to go anywhere. </p><p>But then Lady Luck took pity on me. </p><p>I went to my mailbox one day and found around-trip ticket to Hawaii, courtesy of my best friend, Candace. She was getting marriedon the island of Kauai and wanted me there as her maid of honor.She knew how strapped I was for money, so she paid for everything, booking mefor seven days and six nights at the fanciest resort on the island, the Grand Kiahuna Poipu, where the weddingwas going to be held.</p><p>The easy part was talking my mom into comingup from Monterey to take care of Julie for a week. The hard partwas finding someone to take care of Monk.</p><p>I called a temporary staffing agency. I toldthem the job required basic secretarial work, some transportation, and strong "interpersonalskills." They said they had just the right people. I was sure Monk would gothrough all of them before the week was over and that I would never be able tocall that temp agency again. I didn&#x2019;t care, because I could already feel thesand between my toes, smell the coconut lotion on my skin, and hear Don Hosinging "Tiny Bubbles" to me.</p><p>All I had to do then was break the news toMonk. </p><p>I kept putting it off until finally it wasthe day before I was leaving. Even then, I couldn&#x2019;t seem to find the rightmoment. I still hadn&#x2019;t found it when Monk got a call from Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer, his former partner on the SFPD, asking forhis help.</p><p>That made my predicament even worse. Stottlemeyer brought Monk in to consult whenever they had aparticularly tricky homicide to solve. If I left Monk in middle of aninvestigation, it would make him crazy (or crazier than usual, to be precise).And Stottlemeyer wouldn&#x2019;t be thrilled either,especially if it meant his case would drag on without a solution because Monkwas distracted. </p><p>I cursed myself for not telling Monk beforeand prayed the case would turn out to be a simple one.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Somebody poisoned Dr. Lyle Douglas, theworld-famous heart surgeon, while he was performing a quadruple bypass operationon Stella Picaro, his forty-four-year-old formernurse, at the hospital where she worked. </p><p>Dr. Douglas was midway through the delicateprocedure, which was being observed by a dozen doctors and medical students,when he had a violent seizure and dropped dead. Another surgeon, Dr. TroyClark, had to jump in and save the patient from dying. He succeeded.</p><p>Nobody realized Dr. Douglas had been murdereduntil the autopsy was completed the following day. By then, all the evidencethat might have been left at the crime scene was gone. The operating room hadbeen thoroughly cleaned, the instruments disinfected, the linens washed, and everythingelse discarded as biohazardous waste immediatelyafter the surgery was over.</p><p>There might not have been any evidence, butthere were plenty of suspects. The main one, of course, was Dr. Clark, thesurgeon who saved Stella Picaro on the operatingtable and was being treated as a hero. He also happened to be Dr. Douglas&#x2019;smajor rival. </p><p>Dr. Douglas had a lot of other enemies. Hewas a manipulative egomaniac who&#x2019;d hurt a lot of people, including just abouteverybody on his surgical team, many of the doctors observing the operation,and even the patient he was cutting open when he died.</p><p>But neither Stottlemeyernor his assistant, Lt. Randy Disher, could figure outhow Dr. Douglas was poisoned in front of so many witnesses without anybodyseeing a thing. They were stumped. So they called Monk.</p><p>They briefed Monk at the station andafterward he wanted to visit the scene of the crime. I could have told himabout my trip on the way to the hospital, but I knew if I did that, he wouldn&#x2019;tbe able to concentrate on anything else all day.</p><p>When we got there, he insisted on wearingsurgical scrubs over his clothes, a cap on his head, a mask and goggles on hisface, plastic gloves on his hands, and even paper booties over his shoes beforegoing inside the OR.</p><p>Are you trying to get into the mind of thesurgeon?" I teased him as the two of us stood outside the operating room doors.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m trying to avoid infection," Monk said. </p><p>"Heart disease isn&#x2019;t contagious." </p><p>This building is filled with sick people.The air is thick with deadly germs. The only thing more dangerous than visitinga hospital is drinking out of a water fountain," Monk said. "It&#x2019;s a good thingthere are a lot of doctors around."</p><p>"There&#x2019;s nothing dangerous about drinking froma water fountain, Mr. Monk. I&#x2019;ve been drinking from them all my life."</p><p>"You probably enjoy playing Russian roulette,too."</p><p>Monk stepped into the OR, and I watched as hecarefully surveyed every corner of the room and each piece of equipment. Hisinvestigation of the crime scene resembled an improvised dance with aninvisible partner. He repeatedly circled the room, making sudden pirouettes,gliding back and forth, and dipping every so often to peer under something. Hestopped at the stainless-steel table where the surgery was performed and gazeddown at it as if imagining the patient in front of him. </p><p>He rolled his shoulders and tilted his headas if he were working a kink out in his neck. But I knew that wasn&#x2019;t it. Whatwas irritating him was a detail, some fact that didn&#x2019;t fit where it wassupposed to. Nothing bothered Monk more than disorder. And what&#x2019;s a mystery,after all, but a situation in disarray, crying out for organization--animbalance that needs to be set right? </p><p>"Where&#x2019;s the patient that Dr. Douglas wasoperating on?" Monk asked.</p><p>"She&#x2019;s upstairs," I said. "In the ICU."</p><p>Monk nodded. "Call the captain and ask him tomeet us there."</p><p>* * * * * *</p><p>There&#x2019;s something really creepy aboutintensive care units to me. I&#x2019;ve been in only a couple of them and, while Iknow they exist to save lives, they scare me. The patients connected to allthose machines don&#x2019;t look like people to me anymore, but like corpses some madscientist is trying to reanimate.</p><p>That was the way Stella Picarolooked, even though she was wide-awake. There were all kinds of tubes and wiresconnecting her to an EKG, a respirator, and a toaster oven, for all I knew.Machines beeped and lights blinked and she was alive, so I guess it was all forthe best. Still, I tried not to look at her. It made me too uncomfortable.</p><p>Monk and I were standing next to the nurses&#x2019;station. He was still in his surgical garb and he was breathing funny, almostgasping.</p><p>"Are you feeling all right, Mr. Monk?" Iasked.</p><p>"Fine." </p><p>"Then why are you gasping?"</p><p>"I&#x2019;m trying to limit my breathing," Monksaid.</p><p>I thought about it for a second. "The fewerbreaths, the fewer chances you have of inhaling some virus."</p><p>"You should try it," he said. "It could saveyour life."</p><p>It was scary how good I was getting at understandinghis peculiar way of thinking, his Monkology.&nbsp; That in itself was a pretty strong argumentfor me to get away from him for a while. </p><p>I was about to tell him about the Hawaii trip right then and there, when Stottlemeyer sauntered in, holding a latte from Starbucksin his hand. There was a little bit offoam in his bushy mustache and a fresh stain on his wide, striped tie. I foundhis disheveled appearance endearing, but I knew it drove Monk insane. SometimesI wondered if the captain did it on purpose.</p><p>Lieutenant Disherwas, as usual, right at Captain Stottlemeyer&#x2019;s side.He reminded me of a golden retriever, always bounding around happily,blissfully unaware of all the things he was destroying with his wagging tail.</p><p>Stottlemeyer grinned at Monk. "You know it&#x2019;s against thelaw to impersonate a doctor."</p><p>"I&#x2019;m not," Monk said. "I&#x2019;m wearing this formy own protection."</p><p>"You ought to wear it all the time."</p><p>"I&#x2019;m seriously considering it."</p><p>"I bet you are," Stottlemeyersaid. </p><p>"You have foam in your mustache," Monk said,pointing.</p><p>"Do I?" Stottlemeyercasually dabbed at his mustache with a napkin. "Is that better?"</p><p>Monk nodded. "Your tie is stained." </p><p>Stottlemeyer lifted it up and looked down at it. "So itis."</p><p>"You should change it," Monk said.</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t have another tie with me, Monk. Itwill have to wait."</p><p>"You could buy one," Monk said.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m not going to buy one."</p><p>"You could borrow one from a doctor," Monksaid.</p><p>"You can borrow mine," Dishersaid.</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t want your tie, Randy," Stottlemeyer said, then turned toMonk. "What if I just take mine off and put it in my pocket?"</p><p>"I&#x2019;d know it&#x2019;s there," Monk said.</p><p>"Pretend it isn&#x2019;t," Stottlemeyersaid.</p><p>"I don&#x2019;t know how to pretend," Monk said. "Inever got the hang of it." </p><p>Stottlemeyer handed his latte to Disher,took off his tie, and stuffed it into a biohazard container. </p><p>"Is that better?" Stottlemeyerasked, taking back his latte from Disher.</p><p>"I think we all appreciate it," Monk said,looking at Disher and me. "Don&#x2019;t we?"</p><p>"So what have you got for me that was worthchucking my tie for?" Stottlemeyer asked.</p><p> "The killer."</p><p>Stottlemeyer and Disher bothglanced around the room. So did I. </p><p> "Where?" Stottlemeyer said. "I don&#x2019;t see anyof our suspects."</p><p>Monk tipped his head toward Stella Picaro. Just seeing the breathing tube down her throatnearly triggered my gag reflex.</p><p>"You&#x2019;re talking about <i>her</i>?" Disher said.</p><p>Monk nodded. </p><p>"<i>She</i>did it?" Stottlemeyer said incredulously.</p><p>Monk nodded.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Stottlemeyersaid.</p><p>Monk nodded. I looked back at Stella Picaro. She seemed to be trying to shake her head.</p><p>"Maybe you forgot this part," Stottlemeyer said, "but when Dr. Douglas died, that ladywas unconscious on an operating table, her chest cut wide-open, her beatingheart held in his hands."</p><p>"And based on that flimsy alibi, you wroteher off as a suspect?" Monk said.</p><p>"Yeah, I did," Stottlemeyersaid.</p><p>"Even though you told me she was his surgicalnurse and his mistress for five years?"</p><p>"That&#x2019;s right."</p><p>"Even though when Dr. Douglas finally lefthis wife, it wasn&#x2019;t for her but for a twenty-two-year-old swimsuit model?"</p><p>"Look at her, Monk. She was having a quadruplebypass when the murder was committed. She nearly died on the operating table."</p><p>"That was all part of her cunning plan."</p><p>We all looked at her. She stared back at uswide-eyed, not making a sound. All we heard was the beeping of her EKG--whichsounded kind of erratic to me, but I wasn&#x2019;t a doctor.</p><p>Stottlemeyer sighed. It was a sigh that conveyedweariness and defeat. It was tiring dealing with Monk, and futile arguing withhim about murder. When it comes to homicide, Monk is almost always right.</p><p>"How could she possibly have done it?" Stottlemeyer asked.</p><p>I was wondering the same thing.</p><p>Disher snapped his fingers. "I&#x2019;ve got it. Astral projection!" </p><p>"You&#x2019;re saying her spirit left h...</p></p><h2>The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress</h2><p><b>From the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>I Was Anastasia </i>comes a novel that tantalizingly reimagines a scandalous murder mystery that rocked the nation.</b><br><br>One summer night in 1930, Judge Joseph Crater steps into a New York City cab and is never heard from again. Behind this great man are three women, each with her own tale to tell: Stella, his fashionable wife, the picture of propriety; Maria, their steadfast maid, indebted to the judge; and Ritzi, his showgirl mistress, willing to seize any chance to break out of the chorus line. <br><br>As the twisted truth emerges, Ariel Lawhon&#x2019;s wickedly entertaining debut mystery transports us into the smoky jazz clubs, the seedy backstage dressing rooms, and the shadowy streets beneath the Art Deco skyline.</p><p>Joshilyn Jackson Ariel Lawhon <p><b>Joshilyn Jackson interviews Ariel Lawhon, author of <i>The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress: A Novel</i></b></p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: Your novel revisits an unsolved mystery of Old New York. How did you first find it? What about it made you want to use the truth as a vehicle to drive your own story?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: I&#x2019;d never heard of Joseph Crater until I read an article about him in <i>The New York Post</i> nine years ago. I didn&#x2019;t know that his disappearance was the biggest missing person&#x2019;s case of the twentieth century or that he was a household name for almost fifty years. It was fascinating. But in all of that, what intrigued me most was his wife Stella, and her strange yearly ritual. Starting on the first anniversary of her husband&#x2019;s disappearance, she would go to a bar in Greenwich Village and order two drinks. She&#x2019;d raise one in salute, &#x201c;Good luck, Joe, wherever you are!&#x201d; Then she&#x2019;d drink it and walk out of the bar, leaving the other untouched on the table. She did this every year for thirty-nine years. After reading that article Stella Crater took up permanent residence in my mind. I&#x2019;d close my eyes and she&#x2019;d be there, in that corner booth, a glass of whiskey in her hand, practically daring me to tell her story. So I did.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: You have blended actual historical events so seamlessly into your fiction that I can&#x2019;t tell where truth ends and your imagination takes over. How did you create this world?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: The real Crater mystery is filled with all these fascinating but seemingly disconnected details: mysterious cash-filled envelopes, theater tickets, grand jury investigations, random injuries, missing wills, bribery allegations. I wanted to take all the peripheral details that are often nothing more than footnotes in the historical record and make them integral to the story. But this could only be done when put in contrast with the real people involved: crooked politicians, seedy gangsters, an uncooperative wife, ambitious dancing girls, theater moguls, police officers, nosey reporters. It was all there for the taking but there were gaps. Big questions no one could answer with any certainty, not the least of which is what actually happened to Judge Crater. So I took the details I could verify (hello research you are my drug) and then arranged the blank spaces to fit my own theories. In the end, it became a portrait of what could have happened.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: You have three narrators - which of them is least like you? And did that distance make it easier or harder to write her?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: Don&#x2019;t be like me. Don&#x2019;t write three different stories centered on the same missing man and then try to weave them together into a cohesive whole. You will feel like you&#x2019;re sewing up a bag of cats. And you will, inevitably, find that one character is easier to write than the others (Ritzi). You will like her best even though you aren&#x2019;t supposed to play favorites. This will do strange things to your moral compass, because you like the mistress best. One of the characters will be cold and elusive and you will have nothing in common with her (Stella). She will scare you a little bit and make you doubt your own ability at every turn. Her name will become an expletive. And then there will be one that surprises you (Maria). She will be both devout and sensual. You will make her do things that cause you unreasonable guilt given her imaginary status. You will lose sleep. In the end she will break your heart.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: Where do you do your writing?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: Anywhere. Everywhere. The first flat surface I can find that isn&#x2019;t littered with Legos or used Band Aids. The better question would probably be when do you write (answer: whenever white space shows up on the calendar). Apparently there is this thing called biology. And it WORKS. So thanks to biology I have four children. All of them boys. All of them highly intelligent and off-the-charts active. We call them The Wild Rumpus. And we will not buy nice things until they grow up and leave home. So the when and where of writing is a daily tightrope walk for me. It&#x2019;s probably not the best way to write books but it&#x2019;s the only way I know how and it seems to be working well so far.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p>Ariel Lawhon is co-founder of the popular website She Reads.org.

Her granddaughter is reluctant to go. The weather is terrible and they have to wear fancy, uncomfortable clothes. But as the curtains rise on <em>The Nutcracker</em>, the girl's eyes light up as she's introduced to the magic of the theater. The bright costumes, the intricate dances, the magical music, and a new friend all combine to captivate the girl and to bring color to an otherwise dreary evening.<br><br><em>Waltz of the Snowflakes</em> is Elly MacKay at her finest, mixing her acclaimed paper-cut artwork with vibrant colors in this whimsical, dreamlike, and inspiring wordless picture book. A must-have for any ballet- and theater-obsessed reader and the perfect gift to be shared during the holidays or any time of year when the world outside needs a little bit of color and vibrancy. <br></p><p><strong>Elly MacKay </strong>was dressed up in fancy clothes and taken to the ballet at the age of seven. She has looked at ballet and theater as special treats ever since. Elly is the creator of <em>Butterfly Park,</em> <em>If You Hold a Seed</em>, and <em>Shadow Chasers</em>. Her artwork is recognized worldwide and sold online. Elly lives by Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada, with her husband and children.<strong> </strong>PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;This wordless picture book opens with Christmas just days away, but the only sign of holiday cheer is Gran's holly leaf print dress and her excitement at having tickets to The Nutcracker. Granddaughter is far less enthused at having to venture out into the cold wet night and walk to the theater wearing fancy clothes (except for the high-tops on her feet&#x2014;a nice touch). The situation is not improved when the boy who teases her in the lobby ends up sitting next to her. But then wisps of color come from the orchestra. The act one scene where Clara receives a nutcracker prince from Uncle Drosselmeyer vibrantly leaps from the page, and both boy and girl are enthralled by the music and the action. Bright backlighting makes MacKay's paper-cut artwork look tangible, as if readers could peel the figures from the book and bring them to life. The absence of text allows the expressive illustrations to tell a multilayered story: the granddaughter's progress from sullen reluctance to joy, her and the boy's relationship of initial animosity to friendship, and, of course, the ballet's plot. Even the title serves dual purposes as a nod to a movement in the show and the spontaneous dance between grandmother and granddaughter through the gently falling snow at the end. VERDICT Theatrical, magical, and very much of the season as seeing The Nutcracker itself.&#x2014;Joanna Fabicon, Los Angeles Public Library</p><h2>The Courtship Basket (An Amish Heirloom Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>The second book in Amy Clipston&#x2019;s bestselling Amish Heirloom series!</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;</strong><strong>Readers will be engaged not only with Rachel and Mike&#x2019;s romance, but also with the slowly unwinding story told by Rachel&#x2019;s mother about her courtship days with Rachel&#x2019;s father.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>RT Book Reviews</em></strong></p><p><strong>Years ago, a picnic basket brought two hearts together.

Her recent work has appeared in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review, Vogue, Glamour, Tin House, Electric Literature, Literary Hub. </i>She lives in Brooklyn.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><p>&#x201c;Traitors! Cowards! Good-for-nothings!&#x201d; Ammachy had yelled in 1979, finishing the conversation that would finish her relationship with her son, as Thomas would only come back to India to bury her.</p><p>But what a calamity! An abomination! Divorced from the mother and the motherland in one fell swoop? Who could have seen such a thing coming? Certainly not Amina, who by age eleven was well versed enough in tragedy (she had seen <i>The Champ</i> and <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>) to understand that it came with tinkling music and bad weather.</p><p>And what was there to fear from the sunlight that dappled the Salem train station the morning of their arrival, making everything&#x2014;the packed luggage and the red-shirted coolies and even the beggars&#x2014;seem sweet and full of promise? Nothing, Amina thought, stepping down onto the platform and into the funk of other people&#x2019;s armpits. Plump arms sheathed in sari blouses brushed her cheeks, chai-wallahs shouted into car windows, and a coolie reached impatiently for bags she was not carrying. Somewhere above the din she heard someone calling her father&#x2019;s name.</p><p>&#x201c;Over there, Dad,&#x201d; Akhil said, pointing at something Amina couldn&#x2019;t see, and Thomas gripped her by the shoulders and propelled her forward.</p><p>&#x201c;Babu!&#x201d; He clapped an old man on the back. &#x201c;Good to see you!&#x201d;</p><p>Wrapped in a bulky dhobi and skinny as ever, Babu smiled a toothless smile, his resemblance to a malnourished baby belying his ability to toss large objects onto his head and carry them through crowds, as he did with all four of the family suitcases. Outside the station, Preetham, the driver, loaded the freshly polished Ambassador, while beggars surrounded them, pointing to the children&#x2019;s sneakers and then to their own hungry mouths, as if their appetites could be satisfied by Nikes.</p><p>&#x201c;Ami, come!&#x201d; Kamala called, opening the car door, and once everyone else had taken their places (Preetham and Thomas in the front seat, Akhil, Kamala, and Amina in the back, Babu standing proudly on the back fender), they began the four-block ride home.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the family, Thomas&#x2019;s parents had long ago left Kerala for the drier plains of Tamil Nadu. Settling in a large house at the edge of town, Ammachy and Appachen had opened a combined clinic (she was an ophthalmologist; he was an ENT), and before his sudden death by heart attack at the age of forty-five, they saw 70&nbsp;percent of the heads in Salem.</p><p>&#x201c;A golden time,&#x201d; Ammachy would spit at anyone within distance, going on to list everything since that had disappointed her. Top of her list: her eldest son choosing to marry &#x201c;the darkie&#x201d; and move to America when she had arranged for him to marry Kamala&#x2019;s much lighter cousin and live in Madras; her youngest son becoming a dentist producing &#x201c;the no-brains&#x201d; instead of becoming a doctor and producing another doctor; the many movie theaters and hospitals that had since sprung up around the house, penetrating it with noise and smells.</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody Christ,&#x201d; Thomas breathed as they turned onto Tamarind Road, and Amina followed his gaze. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even see the house anymore!&#x201d;</p><p>This was true. It was also true that what could be seen, or rather, what could not be ignored, was the Wall, Ammachy&#x2019;s solution to the changing world around her. Built of plaster and broken bottles, the Wall grew crooked and taller and more yellowed with every visit, until it resembled nothing as much as a set of monster&#x2019;s dentures fallen from some other world and forgotten on the dusty side of the thoroughfare.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad,&#x201d; Kamala said unconvincingly.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s creepy,&#x201d; Akhil said.</p><p>&#x201c;New gate!&#x201d; Preetham beeped the horn, and the family fell silent as the gate swung open from the inside, pulling the car and its contents down the driveway.</p><p>The house, for its part, had not changed at all, its two stories painted pink and yellow and slanting in the heat like a melting birthday cake. A small crowd had gathered in front of it, and Amina watched them through the window&#x2014;Sunil Uncle, dark and paunchy; his wife, the wheatish and wimpy Divya Auntie; their son, Itty, head weaving from side to side like a skinny Stevie Wonder; Mary-the-Cook, the cook; and two new servant girls. Christmas lights and tinsel twinkled in the pomegranate trees.</p><p>&#x201c;Mikhil! Mittack!&#x201d; Itty gurgled as the car pulled in, arm hooking frantically into the air. He had grown as tall as Sunil since their last visit, and Amina waved back, full of dread. <i>Mittack</i> was her name, according to Itty, and <i>excitability</i> was the condition that made him bite her on occasion, according to the family. Amina fingered the faint half-moon on her forearm, sinking a little in her seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Hullohullohullo!&#x201d; Sunil shouted as the car parked. &#x201c;Welcome, welcome!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Sunil.&#x201d; Thomas opened the door, taking long strides across the lawn to shake hands. &#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>This was a lie, of course, as neither of the brothers was ever particularly glad to see the other, but it was the only way to properly start a visit.</p><p>Sunil fixed a blazing smile on Kamala. &#x201c;Lovely as a rose, my dear!&#x201d; He bestowed cologney kisses on her cheek and then Amina&#x2019;s before turning and clutching his heart. &#x201c;And who is this ruddy tiger? My God, Akhil? Is that you? Blossoming into a king of the jungle, are we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; Akhil sighed.</p><p>Suddenly, two hands wrapped around Amina&#x2019;s neck and squeezed hard, crushing her larynx. She pulled frantically at them, dimly aware of her mother patting Divya&#x2019;s arm in greeting, of the hot breath in her ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Mittack!&#x201d; Itty let go, patting her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; Amina gasped, tears in her eyes. &#x201c;Mom!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Itty.&#x201d; Kamala smiled. She wrapped her arms around the boy, who grunted and buried his face in her neck.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello.&#x201d; Divya stood in front of Amina, slight, pockmarked, and branded with the expression of someone expecting the worst. &#x201c;How was the train?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was nice.&#x201d; Amina loved the overnight train from Madras. She loved the call of the chai-wallahs at every stop, the smell of different dinners cooking in the towns they passed. &#x201c;We got egg sandwiches.&#x201d;</p><p>Divya nodded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re feeling sick now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sick!&#x201d; A voice snapped from behind Divya. &#x201c;Already? Which one?&#x201d;</p><p>Beneath the heat and the house and the blinking lights, Ammachy sat in her wicker chair on the verandah, sweating rings into a sea-foam-green sari blouse. The two years that had passed since their last visit had done nothing to soften her face. Long white whiskers grew out of her chin, and her spine, hunched by decades of complaint, left her head floating some inches above her lap.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Amma.&#x201d; Thomas&#x2019;s fingers were firm on Amina and Akhil&#x2019;s necks as he marched them up the few stairs to where she sat. &#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>Ammachy pointed to the roll of flesh that pressed at the hem of Akhil&#x2019;s polo shirt. &#x201c;<i>Thuddya.</i> What kind of girlish hips are you growing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Ammachy.&#x201d; Akhil leaned in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>She turned to Amina with a wince. &#x201c;Ach. I sent some Fair and Lovely, no? Didn&#x2019;t use it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine, Amma,&#x201d; Thomas said, but as Amina bent to kiss her, Ammachy snatched her face, pinning it between curled fingers.</p><p>&#x201c;You will have to be very clever if you are never going to be pretty. Are you very clever?&#x201d;</p><p>Amina stared at her grandmother, unsure of what to say. She had never thought of herself as particularly clever. She had never thought of herself as particularly bad-looking either, though it was obvious enough now from the faint repulsion that rippled through the hairs on Ammachy&#x2019;s lip.</p><p>&#x201c;Amina won the all-city spelling bee,&#x201d; Kamala announced, pushing Amina&#x2019;s head forward so that her lips landed openly against Ammachy&#x2019;s cheek. She had just enough time to be surprised by the taste of menthol and roses, and then she was pulled into the too-dark house and down the hallway, past Sunil and Divya and Itty and Ammachy&#x2019;s rooms, to a dining room set with tea.</p><p>&#x201c;So train was crowded? Nothing to eat? She&#x2019;s so happy to see you.&#x201d; Divya motioned for Kamala and the kids to sit and pushed a plate of orange sweets at them. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been talking of nothing else for a month.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Itty,&#x201d; Sunil boomed, dragging a lumpy suitcase in behind him. &#x201c;Your uncle is insisting we see what presents he has brought. Shall we take a look?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hullo?&#x201d; Itty nodded vigorously. &#x201c;Look? Look?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, really.&#x201d; Thomas took a seat next to Amina.</p><p>&#x201c;Small-small things,&#x201d; Kamala added.</p><p>Ammachy limped in with a scowl. &#x201c;What is all this nonsense?&#x201d;</p><p>It was: two pairs of Levi&#x2019;s, one bottle of Johnnie Walker Red, three bags of nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios), a pair of Reeboks with Velcro closures, a larger pair of hiking boots, two bottles of perfume (Ana�s Ana�s, Chlo�), four cassette tapes (the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Kenny Rogers, Exile), two jars of Avon scented skin lotion (in Topaze and Unspoken), several pairs of white tube socks, talcum powder, and a candy-cane-shaped tube filled with marshmallow, root beer float, and peppermint flavored lip balms.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too much.&#x201d; Sunil tried to hand back the cassette tapes. &#x201c;Really, we don&#x2019;t need.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What need?&#x201d; Thomas smiled, watching Divya sink her finger into the jar of Avon cream. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to have is all. What do you think, Itty? You like the Velcro?&#x201d;</p><p>Crouched in a Spider-Man pose on the floor, Itty lunged slowly from side to side, mesmerized by the sight of his poufy white feet.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll spoil him.&#x201d; Sunil reached for the scotch bottle, holding it up to the light and studying the label. &#x201c;Shall we try a bit of this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After dinner,&#x201d; Thomas said, and Sunil poured two fingers into his empty teacup, sniffing it.</p><p>&#x201c;The Velcro is big thing in the States now,&#x201d; Kamala explained to everyone with a knowing look. &#x201c;Easy peasy, instead of having to tie the shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>Ammachy snorted. &#x201c;Who else besides this no-brains won&#x2019;t know to tie shoes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vel cow!&#x201d; Itty shouted with unfortunate timing, fastening and unfastening his Reeboks until Ammachy smacked him with a powdered palm. She sniffed at all three flavors of lip balm and licked the tip of one before pushing them into Divya&#x2019;s pile.</p><p>&#x201c;So, you people had a good trip in the airplane?&#x201d; Ammachy asked.</p><p>Thomas nodded. &#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How did you come?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;San Francisco&#x2013;-Honolulu&#x2013;-Taiwan&#x2013;-Singapore.&#x201d;</p><p>Ammachy grunted. &#x201c;Singapore Airlines?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Those girls are pretty, no?&#x201d; She refilled Kamala&#x2019;s cup, saying, &#x201c;Nice complexions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try the hiking boots, Sunil.&#x201d; Thomas pointed to them with his chin. &#x201c;The heel itself has shock absorbers!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Later. I have some work I should be attending to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes, this one with his <i>people&#x2019;s practice.</i>&#x201d; Ammachy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;You would think he was actually saving lives instead of teeth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Teeth are lives, Amma,&#x201d; Sunil said, glowering. &#x201c;People need to eat to live.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, who all do you want to see?&#x201d; she asked Thomas.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I haven&#x2019;t thought about it yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well, your old classmate Yohan Varghese was asking about you the other day. I told you the wife died, no? Not that she was any real help, stupid thing, but two sons to raise on his own! Ach. And we should see Saramma Kochamma of course, just for one afternoon meal. And Dr. Abraham wants to talk to you. He&#x2019;s putting together that rehabilitative center, the one I told you about? Might be a nice thing to see.&#x201d; This last news was delivered with such practiced indifference that even Amina felt embarrassed.</p><p>Thomas reached for a jalebi. He offered the plate to Amina, who shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, he needs someone in head injuries, so I told him you would ring.&#x201d; Ammachy poured milk into her own tea and stirred. &#x201c;Maybe tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really my field.&#x201d; Thomas took a bite. &#x201c;They would only ever need the occasional surgery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, no one asked you to become a brain surgeon,&#x201d; Ammachy snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Thomas said, chewing carefully, &#x201c;they didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Akhil reached for a jalebi, and Ammachy swatted his hand away.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just an option.&#x201d; Ammachy scraped something from the oilcloth. &#x201c;But then I suppose Kamala likes it there? All of this women&#x2019;s- libbing and bra burning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Kamala sat up a little taller in her chair.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s why she was so excited to go in the first place. Always wanting more and more of freedoms, is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who burns the bras?&#x201d; Kamala asked indignantly.</p><p>&#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d; Ammachy glared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who chooses to live in there. Godforsaken place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m</i> the one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who else? If you wanted to come home, Thomas would come. Men only go as far as the wife allows.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; Kamala leaned across the table. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s very interesting, isn&#x2019;t it, Thomas?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amma, please. We&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s foreskin?&#x201d; Amina asked. Everyone looked at her.</p><p>&#x201c;God&#x2019;s foreskin place?&#x201d; Amina repeated, and Akhil kicked her shin under the table. &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is this child saying?&#x201d; Ammachy&#x2019;s face was rigid.</p><p>&#x201c;Time for naps!&#x201d; Kamala pointed toward the stairs. &#x201c;Go. You are overtired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the middle of the day!&#x201d; Akhil protested. &#x201c;We just got here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jet lags! You&#x2019;ll be cranky tomorrow if you don&#x2019;t get some rest. Go!&#x201d; Kamala stood up and ushered them to the base of the stairs, Itty hot on her heels. &#x201c;Itty, you stay with us, okay? Your cousins need to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hullo? Cricket?&#x201d; Itty asked, and Kamala shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Not now. They need to sleep. You stay with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good job,&#x201d; Akhil growled as they left the table and dragged themselves upstairs. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re going to sit up there in the heat forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d; Amina asked.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Forsaken,</i> dope. It means abandoned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; It was getting hotter with every step. Amina&#x2019;s legs felt curiously heavy, as if they were already taking a nap. &#x201c;God abandoned America?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably.&#x201d; Akhil opened the door to the bedroom they shared and flipped the fan onto high, sending a small cloud of mosquitoes in all directions. &#x201c;Ammachy thinks so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does Dad think so?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, stupid. Dad likes it. That&#x2019;s what they were fighting about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were fighting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you think that was? What do you think it is every time we&#x2019;re here? Ammachy wants Dad to move back. Dad doesn&#x2019;t want to move back. Ammachy gets mad at Mom about it. Classic immigrant dysfunction, duh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I know, <i>duh,</i>&#x201d; Amina said, annoyed that she didn&#x2019;t. Akhil was such a know-it-all when it came to India, like he was some big expert just because he was three years older than her and he&#x2019;d been born there instead of in the States, like she had. She lifted the mosquito netting at the edge of one of the twin beds and climbed under. &#x201c;But Mom wants to move back, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Akhil fell back onto the bed next to hers.</p><p>&#x201c;So why does Ammachy get mad at her?&#x201d;</p><p>Akhil thought it over for a minute, then shrugged. &#x201c;Because she doesn&#x2019;t want to get mad at Dad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Amina&#x2019;s head sank into the pillow. &#x201c;Do you want to move back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! India sucks.&#x201d;</p><p>Amina was relieved. This much even she knew. She shut her eyes, surprised by how quickly the blackness of sleep rose up to greet her, swift and persuasive as candor.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s half ...</p></p><h2>Instructions to the Cook: A Zen Master&#39;s Lessons in Living a Life that Matters</h2><p>Zen is not just about what we do in the meditation hall, but what we do in the home, the workplace, and the community. That's the premise of this book: how to cook what Zen Buddhists call "the supreme meal"&#x2014;life. It has to be nourishing, and it has to be shared. And we can use only the ingredients at hand. Inspired by the thirteenth-century manual of the same name by Dogen, the founder of the Japanese Soto Zen tradition, this book teaches us how we can "enlarge the family we're feeding" if we just use some imagination. <br><br> Bernie Glassman founded Greyston Bakery in Yonkers, New York, in 1982 to employ those whom other companies deem unemployable&#x2014;the homeless, ex-cons, recovering addicts, low-skill individuals&#x2014;with the belief that investing in people, and not just products, does pay. He was right. Greyston has evolved into an $8 million-a-year business with clients all over New York City. It is the sole supplier of brownies to Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream, and has even sold cakes to the White House. <br><br>But financial profit is only one of two bottom lines that Greyston is committed to. The other one is social impact, and this goal is certainly being met. The bakery enterprise has led to the creation of the Greyston Foundation, an integrated network of organizations that provide affordable housing, child care, counseling services, and health care to families in the community. Using entrepreneurship to solve the problems of the inner city, Greyston has become a national model for comprehensive community development. Its giving back is more than just sloughing off a percentage of its profits and donating it to charity; it's about working with the community's needs right from the beginning&#x2014;bringing them from the margins to the core. As its company motto goes, "We don't hire people to bake brownies.

The difference begins with boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, where the history and future of the United States Marine Corps intersect in the training of every new recruit. In <i>Making the Corps</i>, Ricks follows a platoon of young men through 11 grueling weeks of boot camp as their drill instructors indoctrinate them into the culture of the Few and the Proud. Many arrive at Parris Island undisciplined and apathetic; they leave as marines.<p> With the end of the cold war, the role of the American military has shifted in emphasis from making war to keeping peace. "The best way to see where the U.S. military is going is to look at the marines today," says Ricks, as the other armed forces have begun to emulate the marine model. To understand Parris Island--a central experience in the life of every marine--is to understand the ethos of the Marine Corps. Ricks examines the recent changes in the <i>Standard Operating Procedures for Recruit Training</i> (the bible of Parris Island), which indicate how the corps is dealing with critical social and political issues like race relations, gender equality, and sexual orientation. <i>Making the Corps</i> pierces the USMC's "sis-boom-bah" mythology to help outsiders understand this most esoteric and eccentric of U.S. armed forces. <i>--Tim Hogan</i></p><p>Semper Fi. The few, the proud. From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli. Once a Marine, always a Marine. The United States Marine Corps, with its fiercely proud tradition of excellence in combat, its hallowed rituals, and its unbending code of honor, is part of the fabric of American myth. No other group in America leaves so deep and permanent a mark on its members. Today, though, the Marine Corps feels increasingly besieged, at war with a new kind of enemy the vast social and political forces that it feels threaten to destroy its values. <i>Making the Corps</i> visits the front lines of that war: boot camp, Parris Island, South Carolina, "where the difference begins." Here, old values are stripped away and new, Marine Corps values, forged. Acclaimed military journalist Thomas E. Ricks follows sixty-three raw recruits, the men of recruit platoon 3086, from their hometowns to Parris Island, through boot camp, and into their first year as Marines. As three fierce drill instructors fight a battle for the hearts and minds of this unforgettable group of young men, a larger picture emerges, brilliantly painted, of the growing gulf that divides the military from the rest of America.</p></p><h2>The Magical Tree: A Children&#39;s Book Inspired by Gustav Klimt (Children&#39;s Books Inspired by Famous Artworks)</h2><p>Inspired by Klimt&#x2019;s famous mural <i>The Tree of Life</i>, this dreamily illustrated children&#x2019;s book tells the story of a magical tree whose fruit saves lives.

A former staff writer and senior editor at <i>The Washington Post</i>, he lives in Washington, D.C.THE GATHERING <br>MAY 5, 1944 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>IN THIS ROOM, the greatest Anglo-American military leaders of World War II gathered to rehearse the deathblow intended to destroy Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich. It was the 1,720th day of the war. Admirals, generals, field marshals, logisticians, and staff by the score climbed from their limousines and marched into a Gothic building of St. Paul&#x2019;s School. American military policemen&#x2014;known as Snowdrops for their white helmets, white pistol belts, white leggings, and white gloves&#x2014;looked closely at the 146 engraved invitations and security passes distributed a month earlier. Then six uniformed ushers escorted the guests, later described as &#x201c;big men with the air of fame about them,&#x201d; into the Model Room, a cold auditorium with black columns and hard, narrow benches reputedly designed to keep young schoolboys awake. The students of St. Paul&#x2019;s School had long been evacuated to rural England&#x2014;German bombs had shattered seven hundred windows across the school&#x2019;s campus. <br>Top-secret charts and maps now lined the Model Room. Since January, the school had served as headquarters for the British 21st Army Group, and here the detailed planning for Operation OVERLORD, the Allied invasion of France, had gelled. As the senior officers found their benches in rows B through J, some spread blankets across their laps or cinched their overcoats against the chill. Row A, fourteen armchairs arranged elbow to elbow, was reserved for the highest of the mighty, and now these men began to take their seats. The prime minister of England, Winston Churchill, dressed in a black coat and holding his usual Havana cigar, entered with U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose title, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, signaled his leadership over all of the Allied forces in Europe. Neither cheers nor applause greeted them, but the assembly stood as one when King George VI strolled down the aisle to sit on Eisenhower&#x2019;s right. Churchill bowed to his monarch, then resumed puffing his cigar. <br>As they waited to begin at the stroke of ten A.M., these big men with their air of importance had reason to rejoice in their joint victories and to hope for greater victories still to come in this war. <br>Since September 1939, war had raged across Europe, eventually spreading to North Africa and as far east as Moscow, capital of the Soviet Union. Germany, a country humiliated after World War I, had seen the rise of Adolf Hitler, a dictator who had dreams of conquering the continent. Beginning with Poland, his armies had crushed one nation after another, destroying cities and killing or enslaving millions of people. His collaborators in the Axis alliance, particularly Japan and Italy, pushed their own campaigns of aggression in Asia and Africa. <br>Hitler&#x2019;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, and Japan&#x2019;s attack in December of that year on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, led to a grand alliance determined to stop the Axis. The United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union were the major Allied powers, but they were supported by dozens of other countries. At an enormous cost in blood, Soviet armies pushed the German invaders back through eastern Europe, mile by mile. German casualties there exceeded three million, and in 1944 nearly two-thirds of Hitler&#x2019;s combat power remained tied up in the east. <br>The United States and Britain, meanwhile, had defeated German and Italian forces in North Africa. They then moved north across the Mediterranean Sea to conquer much of Italy, which surrendered and abandoned the Axis. The Third Reich, as Hitler called his empire, was ever more vulnerable to air attack. Allied planes flying from Britain, Italy, and Africa dropped thousands of tons of bombs on Germany and on German forces along various battle fronts. City by city, factory by factory, Germany was a country increasingly in flames. Although they paid a staggering cost in airplanes and flight crews, the U.S. Army Air Forces, Britain&#x2019;s Royal Air Force, and the Canadian Air Force had won mastery of the European skies, even as Allied navies controlled the seas. <br>By the late spring of 1944, the Allies were ready to attempt something that had long seemed impossible: to invade what the Germans called &#x201c;Fortress Europe&#x201d; and begin the final campaign that would free citizens who had been enslaved since Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. The hour of liberation had nearly arrived. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Rick Atkinson <br></p><h2>Without Pity: Ann Rule&#39;s Most Dangerous Killers</h2><p><b>THEY KILL WITHOUT CONSCIENCE.<br> ANN RULE PORTRAYS THEIR SHATTERING CRIMES WITHOUT PITY.</b> <br> In eight stunning Case Files volumes, from <i>A Rose for Her Grave</i> to the #1 blockbuster <i>Last Dance, Last Chance,</i> Ann Rule reigns as "America's best true-crime writer" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>). Now, she updates the most astonishing cases from that acclaimed series -- and presents shocking, all-new true-crime accounts -- in one riveting anthology. In every explosive chapter of <i>Without Pity,</i> Ann Rule deepens her unrelenting exploration of the evil that lies behind the perfect facades of heartless killers...and the deadly compulsions of greed and power that shatter their outward trappings of material success. <br> They are the admired, trusted neighbor; the affable family man; the sexy, charismatic lover; the high-achieving professional. Perhaps most frightening of all is that they are heroes in their own minds. But when someone gets in the way of their deluded dreams, they are capable of deadly acts of violence with no remorse. Analyzing the true nature of the sociopathic mind in chilling detail, Ann Rule traces the murderous crimes of seemingly ordinary men -- killers who drew their unsuspecting victims into their twisted worlds with devastating consequences.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.<b>Chapter One: The Tumbledown Shack</b><br><br><i>After writing more than a thousand articles about homicide cases, I suppose it's natural that some of them blur slightly in my memory. However, there are those that I recall vividly, and I even remember my own life at the time I first researched their tragic details. The story that follows brings back gloomy recollections of four days when I was trapped by a blizzard in Wenatchee, Washington. The sheriff of adjoining Okanogan County had given me a ride from Seattle over the Cascade Mountains on November 16, 1978, and I planned to take the bus back after I'd talked to Chelan County homicide detectives. But a huge snowstorm clogged the mountain passes and no car, bus, train, or plane could get through. That meant I couldn't get home until the road thawed.<br><br>All the sidewalks in Wenatchee were covered with four or five inches of ice that weekend and many stores had closed. Stuck in a little motel, all I had to read was the police file of this horrifying case. I found no diversion from horror when I turned on the television set. The news had just broken that Reverend Jim Jones, the cult leader of the Peoples' Temple from San Francisco, had forced his hapless congregation to drink poisoned Kool-Aid at "Jonestown," in Guyana. Of his 1,100 followers, 973 were dead, and so were California state representative Leo J. Ryan and most of the staff and film crew who had gone with him to Guyana to investigate Jones. There was nothing for me to watch beyond blanket coverage of that story on every channel and a screen filled with a sea of bodies.<br><br>I spent those days completely alone in the dead of winter only thirty-five miles from where the case I was studying had happened in the blazing summer heat. By the time the ice thawed, I knew this story of two vulnerable young women by heart and it stays in my mind to this day.<br><br>Like those who died in Jonestown, the Chelan County victims had been lulled into the false belief that they were safe, and they too trusted enough that they failed to see the evil behind a pleasant facade.</i><br><br>It would seem that a double homicide that happened almost thirty years ago would have been solved by now. It has certainly not been forgotten. I still meet people who were closely connected to the victims, people for whom time has no meaning. Technically, it is an open case. Yet, over and over again, one man confessed to the murders of two beautiful young women. Was he telling the truth, or was he only throwing up a smokescreen that clouded the investigation so that the <i>real</i> killer was never caught?<br><br>You be the judge.<br><br>Chelan County, Washington, is only a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Seattle, but it lies on the other side of the mountains in eastern Washington, in a climate where the landscape is completely different. The weather, the vegetation, and the topography of Chelan County might as well be three or four states away. Chelan County is fruit-growing country, particularly Delicious apples, and vacation country, a place far away from the congestion of the increasingly industrial west sides of Oregon and Washington, where Portland and Seattle traffic rivals that of L.A. and New York City, and where new housing developments cover fertile valleys with cement streets and perfectly landscaped yards.<br><br>The town of Chelan is forty miles north of Wenatchee, and it exists mostly because of expansive Lake Chelan, the second largest inland lake in America. Tourists flock to Lake Chelan, where deep blue water cuts through dry hills for a hundred miles or more, ending at the isolated hamlet of Stehekin, accessible only by boat or seaplane. Visitors board the <i>Lady of the Lake</i> in Chelan for a four-hour leisurely cruise to another world. Vacationers and those attending conferences fill the myriad resorts curving along Lake Chelan.<br><br>The road between Wenatchee and Chelan winds through quite beautiful country. To the east, poplar trees stand like sentries and as windbreaks for the apple orchards close to the mighty Columbia River. Close to the town of Entiat, roadside stands sell fresh produce, honey, candy, pickles, and flowers. The water thundering from Rocky Reach Dam is awe inspiring, and its grounds thrill little kids; every thatch of spreading junipers provides shelter for rabbits and other little creatures, the descendants of Easter bunnies and abandoned pets released there decades before. Park rangers feed and watch over them.<br><br>It all feels very safe and benign.<br><br>But farther north, the land becomes much more rugged. In high summer and early autumn, rolling hills burn brown, and tumbleweeds, wild daisies, and sagebrush are the only plants that grow. Too often, forest fires erupt and the land burns black as the wind carries flames from tree to tree and across roads. Animals -- and humans too -- can be trapped with no way out. Many come to Chelan County for reasons other than vacationing. When harvest time comes, migrant workers and young people with the stamina to work hard for several weeks head up U.S. Highway 97 to find jobs bringing in the crops.<br><br>In the mid-seventies, nobody gave a second glance to the strangers and teenagers who stood beside the roads with their thumbs out. They were such a familiar sight that they became part of the environment. It was past the time of peace, love, and hippie beads, but many young people still clung to those beliefs, and they continued to hitchhike.<br><br>At various spots, the road north to Chelan suddenly disappears into black tunnels cut into the rock cliffs, only to emerge into blinding sunlight. There are well-maintained homes along the road to Chelan, but there are also gray pioneer shacks, long deserted and leaning toward the ground. In September and October, the fruit pickers arrive, followed in late fall by hunters stalking deer and elk.<br><br>Chelan County deputies expect extra work in autumn because so many transients swell the population. Sometimes the officers are called out for homicides, but the vast majority of calls are the result of drunken fights, over a bottle of "Mad Dog" or "Night Train" wine, among the nameless drifters who follow the crops.<br><br>It was 2:35 on Tuesday afternoon, September 30, 1975, when Deputy D. B. Mayo received a call from the radio operator at the Chelan Police Department. Someone had gone to the farm-labor office in town wanting to report a "possible rape." The attack had apparently occurred somewhere out in the county.<br><br>Mayo contacted Bill Myer, who was staying in a pickers' cabin at the Hesperian Orchards. Myer appeared agitated as he tried to explain what he'd seen.<br><br>"Me and my friend Hal Oxley were out hiking in the hills behind the orchards when we found a couple of chicks in a shed....I think they've been raped," he said hurriedly.<br><br>Myer said he had been spooked by what he'd seen and didn't stay around long enough to check to see if the victims were alive or dead. If they <i>were</i> dead, Myer and his friend would become the first suspects, but Mayo didn't mention that. He simply studied the excited young man.<br><br>"But I'm afraid they might be dead," Myer said. "I can lead you back there where I saw them if you want."<br><br>Deputy Mayo urged the young picker to hop into his patrol car. They picked up Oxley, and the deputy sped to the area the witnesses pointed out. They directed him to Old Downey Road, which leads off U.S. 97, and headed up that road for a little over a mile, passing some weathered ranch buildings. The man who owned the ranch verified that there was, indeed, an old shed about two miles further on.<br><br>Since Oxley and Myer said they had stumbled upon the shack while they were walking in the rugged hills, they were a little disoriented and had trouble figuring out how to get back to the spot where they'd seen the girls.<br><br>Mayo drove along the increasingly rutted dirt road and was just about to turn back, when they suddenly spotted an old A-frame shed that weather must have battered for half a century. It was about to collapse.<br><br>"That's it," Myer said. "That's where I saw them."<br><br>The deputy eased out of his patrol car and started to walk toward the pile of weathered boards when suddenly a large gray dog -- or wolf -- bared its teeth at him and barked ferociously. He paused, and saw that it <i>was</i> a dog, probably a husky-German shepherd mix, that was barring the way.<br><br>"I'm pretty good with animals," Myer called out from the car. "Let me try."<br><br>For a fleeting moment, Mayo wondered if he might have walked into a trap. He was far from backup with two scruffy-looking strangers, and now Myer seemed able to get closer to the dog than he had. Maybe the dog already knew Myer. The deputy wondered if there really <i>were</i> two girls inside the shack.<br><br>But Myer seemed sincere as he talked calmly to the dog, and grudgingly the animal finally let him approach and allowed himself to be tied to a post.<br><br>Mayo peered into the old shed through some gaping one-by-eights, his eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness inside. The girls were there, all right. At this point, he had no idea if they had been raped, but they were most certainly dead. And they probably had been dead for days.<br><br>Even in death, the two girls -- one flaxen-haired, the other with brown hair -- showed signs of their former beauty. Their bodies were tanned and slender.<br><br>Mayo backed away from the terrible sight and ran to his patrol car to radio for help from the sheriff's headquarters in Wenatchee. There was no possibility that the girls had perished accidentally. From the mote-filled beams of sunlight that filtered into the shack, Mayo saw bruises and dried blood on their bodies. Either they had been attacked here in the shed or someone had carried their bodies here to hide them.<br><br>While the three men waited for help, they filled a battered metal dish with water from their canteens for the dog, which had stationed himself loyally next to his owners' bodies, possibly waiting there for days.<br><br>Right after receiving Deputy Mayo's call, Chief of Detectives Bill Patterson and detectives Jerry Monroe and Tillman Wells had left their offices in Wenatchee and headed north along the Columbia River.<br><br>Careful not to step on physical evidence that might have been left behind at the murder site, the Chelan County investigators squinted into the dilapidated structure. The brunette lay closer to the entrance than her companion. She was partially clothed, wearing hiking clothes and boots. And dried blood covered what they could see of her body. Someone had apparently tossed her backpack on top of her, perhaps in a hurried attempt to hide her body, perhaps as a gesture of remorse for what he had done to her. Most of her wounds appeared to be in the upper portion of her body.<br><br>The second girl's body was nearby. She was nude, and her jeans, thick-soled hiking boots, and backpack were beside her. The blond girl had fought her killer: her hands had wounds from a sharp object.<br><br><i>Who were they?</i> The dead young women looked so much like the hundreds of girls who moved through the Chelan County area in picking season. They were obviously experienced campers and their gear had been well used. How they had come to be in this lonely shed so far off the main road was a puzzle. It would seem that they would have to have been familiar with the region to even know the ramshackle structure was here. Either that or they had been led here by someone who knew about it.<br><br>Not knowing the victims' names, the three detectives temporarily dubbed them "Victim Number One" and "Victim Number Two."<br><br>They lifted the blond girl's backpack carefully from the shed. Maybe Victim Number Two's belongings would help identify her. The bag contained the usual: clothes, makeup, camping gear. But they also found two prescription pill bottles from a pharmacy in Lincoln City, Oregon. The name "Pat Weidner" was on one bottle; the other prescription was for "Brad King."<br><br>They found a purse in the shack, and it contained $59.08. The detectives also fished a tin can from one of the packs, and it had two $10 bills in it -- emergency money perhaps. Robbery was an unlikely motive for double murder.<br><br>The purse held a Social Security card and an Oregon driver's license, both in the name of "Beverly Mae Johnson." Her birth date was listed as May 14, 1952, and her description was 5 feet 3 inches and 110 pounds. The address was also in Lincoln City, a resort town along the Oregon coast. She'd been very young, only twenty-three.<br><br>Tentatively, Patterson figured that the petite blond girl was Johnson, and the taller brunette was almost surely Weidner. That was much easier to deduce than whatever reasons had brought the victims hundreds of miles from home to a rundown shack in the wilderness.<br><br>Dr. Robert Bonafaci, the Chelan County Medical Examiner, arrived at the scene with Detective Don Danner. Bonafaci said that it appeared that both women had died from having their throats cut. Patty Weidner, who had been taller and huskier than her friend, had probably had no warning of danger. Either she had been asleep or she hadn't expected to be attacked because she apparently had put up no fight at all. But Beverly Johnson, who looked to weigh no more than a hundred pounds, had fought valiantly. She had the deep cuts in her hands -- defensive wounds. Whether rape had been the motivation for such violence would have to be determined at the autopsy.<br><br>Dr. Bonafaci gave his OK for the bodies to be transported to Wenatchee to await postmortem examinations. Now the Chelan County detectives could move in to work the crime scene.<br><br>Patterson felt both girls had been killed in or near the shed. Blood droplets marked the sandy soil and led them to a spot about six feet from its entrance. Here, there had been a large puddle of blood, long dried now into a dark brown segmented splotch. They found even more blood fifty-six feet away, and in several areas where the dog had dug frantically into the soft soil. These too bore traces of his mistresses' blood.<br><br>Had the victims screamed for help? It would have done little good. They were miles away from anyone who could have rescued them. No one on the ranch two miles down the road could have heard their screams.<br><br>Patterson and his crew of detectives wondered if the dog might prove to be their best -- albeit silent -- witness. He had been very protective of the victims' bodies, and he must have tried to defend the girls when they were attacked. If he had managed to bite the killer or killers, his bite marks in their flesh could be compared to his teeth with a scanning electron microscope.<br><br>Now that the bodies he'd guarded were gone, the dog paced nervously.<br><br>The investigators searched the second backpack. There was nothing in it that would help identify its owner. They did find a pocketknife with the initials "G.B." scratched on the handle. That didn't match either victim's initials.<br><br>By 7:00 P.M., the shadows of the hills encroaching upon the crime scene cast it in odd purplish light. But the Chelan County probers had managed to bag and label the last of the evidence before sundown. The detectives had sketched the scene and photographed it, and even made moulage castings of tire tracks in the area. Still, they feared the moulages would be of little use; the earth was baked so hard and dry that little dust devils whirled.<br><br>Now Detective Chief Patterson and his men would have to seek positive identification for the two young victims, and somehow backtrack on their journey to Chelan. It was a long way from the Oregon coast to these isolated hills.<br><br>Their trail was relatively cold; Dr. Bonafaci felt the girls had been dead for more than thirty-six hours.

The book also offers practical guidance for directly applying it in clinical work.</p><p>In the book, author Niklas T�rneke presents the building blocks of RFT: language as a particular kind of relating, derived stimulus relations, and transformation of stimulus functions. He then shows how these concepts are essential to understanding acceptance and commitment therapy and other therapeutic models. <strong>Learning RFT</strong> shows how to use experiential exercises and metaphors in psychological treatment and explains how they can help your clients. This book belongs on the bookshelves of psychologists, psychotherapists, students, and others seeking to deepen their understanding of psychological treatment from a behavioral perspective.</p></p><p>Relational frame theory (RFT) is a theory of language and cognition that upends traditional cognitive paradigms and forms the foundation of today's cutting-edge therapies, including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). <b>Learning RFT</b> makes RFT accessible to clinicians for the first time and explains how RFT principles can be directly applied in clinical work.<b>Niklas T�rneke, MD</b>, is a psychiatrist, and has worked as a senior psychiatrist in the department of general psychiatry in his hometown of Kalmar, Sweden, from 1991 until he started a private practice in 1998.

I&#x2019;d allowed her to wear her gray cloak indoors because the morning fires hadn&#x2019;t yet been laid. Fog pressed in against the high windows, darkening the stone hall. For Sarah&#x2019;s sake, I kept a smile on my face. My fear could not win today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Will he beat me, Henrietta? I mean, Miss Howel?&#x201d; She often forgot to use my last name, but I&#x2019;d only become a teacher two months before.

Granted, I&#x2019;d never met a sorcerer, but Sarah didn&#x2019;t need to know that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She smiled and sighed. How simple to reassure her. How difficult to reassure myself, for why would a royal sorcerer travel to Yorkshire for an audience with a child? Was the war against the Ancients going so poorly that he needed young girls, armed with sewing needles and a little French, for the front lines?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No. He had heard about the fires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We entered the parlor to find two men seated before the hearth, sipping their tea. This was the only heated room in the entire school, and I rubbed my numb fingers in appreciation. Sarah raced past the men to warm her hands and, embarrassingly, her backside before the fireplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Miss Howel!&#x201d; our headmaster snapped, leaping up from his chair. &#x201c;Control that child at once.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I motioned Sarah back to me, and we curtsied together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good day, Mr. Colegrind,&#x201d; I murmured. Colegrind was a pale, hook-nosed gentleman with gray whiskers and a gray personality. When I was five, he&#x2019;d terrified me. Now that I was sixteen, I found him repulsive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He frowned. &#x201c;Why does Sarah wear her cloak?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The fires haven&#x2019;t been lit, sir,&#x201d; I said, stating what should have been bloody obvious. Dreadful man. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want her shivering before our illustrious guest.&#x201d; Colegrind sniffed. I gave him my least sincere smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other man, who had been surveying our scene with a cup of tea, rose to his feet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; the sorcerer said. &#x201c;Little girls must keep warm.&#x201d; He knelt before Sarah. &#x201c;How are you, my dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This man couldn&#x2019;t be a sorcerer. I&#x2019;d always pictured the royal Order as being filled with humorless men who wore simple robes and smelled of cabbage water. This gentleman was more like a grandfather from a storybook, with a shock of curling salt-and-pepper hair, dimpled cheeks, and warm brown eyes. He swept off his cape, trimmed with sable fur, and wrapped it around Sarah. She hugged herself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There, now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just the right fit.&#x201d; He nodded to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very good to take such care of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I lowered my eyes. &#x201c;Thank you, sir,&#x201d; I mumbled. As he stood, I noticed something hanging in a sheath by his side. It was the length of a sword, but it had to be his sorcerer&#x2019;s stave, the great instrument of his power. I&#x2019;d heard of such things but never glimpsed one. I gasped without thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Agrippa patted the handle. &#x201c;Would you like to see it?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bloody fool, I was supposed to be unnoticeable today. For once, I was grateful for Colegrind&#x2019;s interruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Master Agrippa,&#x201d; Colegrind said, &#x201c;shall we proceed?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sorcerer guided Sarah to a chair while I remained by the wall, invisible as always. Schoolteachers don&#x2019;t stand out naturally, and I was far too thin and dark-haired to make much of an impact. Granted, I didn&#x2019;t want to stand out to Agrippa today, not if he&#x2019;d come about the fires. I exhaled, praying that my heartbeat would slow. Please say that he had come for some other reason. The scenery, the terrible April weather, anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sorcerer produced a toffee from his coat and handed it to Sarah. While she munched, Agrippa took a lit candle and held it before her. The flame flickered. Grabbing a fistful of my skirt, I squeezed to distract myself. I wouldn&#x2019;t be afraid, because fear often summoned the . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t be afraid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Think of the flame,&#x201d; Agrippa whispered. &#x201c;Think of fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No. As if responding to the sorcerer&#x2019;s words, my body grew warm, desperately warm. I slipped my hands behind my back, knotted my fingers together, and prayed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah was clearly doing her best to be helpful, thinking so hard that her face turned bright red. The candle did nothing in response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie,&#x201d; Colegrind ordered Sarah. &#x201c;If you hide anything, Master Agrippa will know. Do you want him to think you a bad girl?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A bad girl. That was whom they hunted. Eleven years earlier, girls with magic would&#x2019;ve been tolerated. Now, my God, only death awaited them. Awaited me. I curled my toes in my shoes, bit my tongue until my eyes watered. My fingers burned so badly. . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at the flame!&#x201d; Colegrind said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pressed my palms against the cold stone wall. I thought of freezing things, like snow and ice. Hold on. Hold on. . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah burst into tears. Between Colegrind&#x2019;s cruelty and my own physical pain, I snapped. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to make her cry.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The men turned. Agrippa raised his eyebrows in surprise. Colegrind looked as if he&#x2019;d like to strike me down where I stood. With a sorcerer present, he&#x2019;d have to contain himself, though after Agrippa left, I suspected I&#x2019;d feel the headmaster&#x2019;s birch cane. Beatings were his favorite form of exercise. But the burning eased somewhat, so my outburst had been worth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Agrippa said, &#x201c;Miss Howel is right. There&#x2019;s no need to fret, Sarah.&#x201d; He shushed her crying and waved his hand above the candle. He collected the fire into his palm, where it hovered mere inches above his skin. He then took his stave&#x2014;it was a plain wooden staff, quite ordinary-looking&#x2014;and pointed it at the flame. Concentrating, he made the fire dance and swirl into different shapes before extinguishing it with one deft movement. Mouth open in astonishment, Sarah applauded wildly, her tears forgotten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all done,&#x201d; Agrippa said, giving her another toffee. Sarah took it and ran from the room as fast as she could. Fortunate child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I apologize for the inexcusable outbursts, Master Agrippa,&#x201d; Colegrind said, glaring at me. &#x201c;At the Brimthorn School for Girls, we try to curb female waywardness and insolence.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He could try to curb me all he liked. But right now that was the least of my worries. My hands were beginning to burn again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I find a dash of insolence to be quite enjoyable from time to time.&#x201d; Agrippa smiled at me. &#x201c;Would you be so kind as to bring me the next girl, my dear? I will be testing every child at this school.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If he was testing all thirty-five of them, he had to be searching for a witch. I groaned inwardly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. I&#x2019;ll return shortly.&#x201d; I left the room, breaking into a run. I had to get outside. Pushing through the front door, I raced out the yard and up the hill. Just a few more steps and I&#x2019;d be hidden from sight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I collapsed to my knees as the fire spilled from my hands. Blue flames tickled my outstretched palms. I closed my eyes and sighed as I grabbed fistfuls of the damp grass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Colegrind and Master Agrippa couldn&#x2019;t know, not ever. Female magic&#x2014;witchcraft&#x2014;was criminal, and the sentence, death. As the flames slowed and sparks glinted off my fingertips, I felt someone sit behind me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a sorcerer from the royal Order here to test the girls,&#x201d; I told Rook, without turning around. Only my dearest friend would react with nonchalance when my hands were burning. Smoke hissed out from between my fingers. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s looking for the one starting the fires.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is why you should only unleash it out on the moor. I&#x2019;ve told you,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t always have that luxury, you know.&#x201d; If my temper got the best of me, if something startled me, if Colegrind did something particularly loathsome, the fire would come upon me. I could never control it for long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The sorcerer won&#x2019;t test you, will he?&#x201d; Rook leaned his back to mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;As a teacher I&#x2019;m spared, thank heavens. Can anyone down there see us?&#x201d; I was fairly safe here, but not as far away as I&#x2019;d have liked. If someone came up the hill unexpectedly, it wouldn&#x2019;t end well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not with me sitting around and ignoring my work.&#x201d; I could tell from his tone that he was smiling. &#x201c;Whoever looks up here will only find me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I whispered, nudging his arm. &#x201c;I should get back. They&#x2019;ve more girls to test.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Think of the cold,&#x201d; Rook said as he rose and helped me to my feet. His left hand gripped mine tightly, and he winced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do your scars hurt?&#x201d; I asked, pressing a hand to his chest. I could imagine the older teachers clucking at my &#x201c;forward&#x201d; behavior, but we&#x2019;d known each other since we were children. Granted, Rook was attractive, with sharp, elegant features and blue eyes. His hair was still the same flaxen down it had been when we were eight. He looked like a poet or a gentleman, I&#x2019;d always thought, even if he was only a stable boy. But most people would turn away from Rook, for all his beauty, if they knew what he kept hidden beneath his shirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The scars were terrible. They weren&#x2019;t visible, as he took care to button himself up, but they were there. Most who suffer an Ancient&#x2019;s attack die. Rook had been one of the lucky few to survive, but he&#x2019;d paid dearly for his life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bit more painful than usual. You know how bad it gets in damp weather,&#x201d; he said. As if in response, thunder rumbled in the distance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Meet me after the girls are tested,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring the paste.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know how to make a fellow happy, Nettie.&#x201d; He nodded, his eyes serious. &#x201c;Be careful.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Always,&#x201d; I said, and returned to the school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two hours later I knelt in the empty parlor. Tears filled my eyes as the cane landed across the back of my neck. Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, I counted. Three to go. I pictured banks of snow in winter. Thankfully, I&#x2019;d gotten through the rest of the students&#x2019; tests with only an occasional flush of heat. Twenty. A warm trickle of blood ran down my neck and into my collar. I tried to rise to my feet, but Colegrind gripped my shoulder and kept me in place. Damn him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You were a wayward child, Henrietta. Do not allow your passions to lead you astray as a young woman.&#x201d; I stifled a shudder as Colegrind&#x2019;s hand trailed across my back. He&#x2019;d taken to &#x201c;noticing&#x201d; me in such ways these past three years. Disgusting man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said automatically. It was the single acceptable answer to Colegrind&#x2019;s tirades. A slow heat prickled my palms. If only I could loose my anger and show him the response he deserved, but that was an insane thought. As I got to my feet, Agrippa entered the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Beg pardon,&#x201d; he said, and stopped. His eyes flicked to Colegrind&#x2019;s cane, to me. I put a hand to the back of my neck to hide the marks, but I could tell he understood. His next words were cold and clipped. &#x201c;Mr. Colegrind, there seems to be confusion with my carriage.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The servants are useless,&#x201d; Colegrind said, as though we should pity him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps you might see to it yourself, then.&#x201d; That was an order dressed as a request. Colegrind tightened his jaw, on the verge of talking back, and then thought better of it. He left, grumbling to himself. Agrippa came toward me, concern written on his face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He spoke so kindly that I felt tears forming at the corners of my eyes. I nodded and began neatening the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Colegrind&#x2019;s angry that we didn&#x2019;t find the one starting the fires,&#x201d; I said, placing a chair against the wall. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a hard three years for him. He was certain the culprit would be discovered.&#x201d; I felt a twinge of pride; the old fool was disappointed again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Has it really been going on for three years?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes. Mostly it&#x2019;s been patches of fire around the stables, but several of the headmaster&#x2019;s favorite coats have met &#x2018;accidental&#x2019; deaths.&#x201d; I worked to keep glee out of my voice. &#x201c;I would give you a list of those who dislike Mr. Colegrind, but I fear that wouldn&#x2019;t narrow your search.&#x201d; I knew it was bold to speak this way, but Agrippa laughed. &#x201c;How did you hear of us, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My Order keeps its collective ear to the ground for cases like these,&#x201d; he said. I turned to look at him. He seemed to be choosing his words with care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Cases of witchcraft?&#x201d; I nearly stumbled over the word.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In a sense.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What you did with the fire was brilliant,&#x201d; I said, straightening a corner of the rug. &#x201c;I mean, putting on that show for Sarah.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Agrippa laughed. &#x201c;I appreciate a good audience.&#x201d; The rain became a dim roar on the roof. I winced as I listened to it. &#x201c;Really, are you all right?&#x201d; Agrippa asked, noticing my reaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They say that rain usually brings Familiars with it. Or, heaven forbid, one of the Ancients.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this, Agrippa sobered and nodded. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to fear. The only Ancient who favors this weather is Korozoth, and he&#x2019;s near London at present.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Korozoth, the great Shadow and Fog. They called him the fiercest warrior of all the Seven Ancients. &#x201c;Have you ever fought him?&#x201d; Thoughts of Agrippa rising into the air against a giant black cloud flashed through my mind, as thrilling a picture as I could create.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;On several occasions. This doesn&#x2019;t frighten you?&#x201d; He said it with a laugh. I&#x2019;d sat down in a chair, entranced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I always want news of how the war&#x2019;s progressing.&#x201d; I knew I should wish him a speedy departure, but my curiosity got the better of me. I&#x2019;d spent countless childhood evenings awake in my bed, watching shadows and moonlight form images on the ceiling. I&#x2019;d imagined them as monsters, pictured myself meeting them in battle. Miss Morris, the head teacher, had sniffed and informed me how unfeminine those dreams were.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How old were you when the Ancients arrived?&#x201d; Agrippa said as he took a seat opposite me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Five.&#x201d; I remembered hiding under the bed when the news first came, listening as my aunt shrieked orders to our maid. We had to pack only what we needed, she said, because we must travel by nightfall. Clutching my doll to my chest, I whispered that I would protect us. Now I nearly laughed to think of it. My doll, my aunt, my old life in Devon&#x2014;all had vanished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never seen one of the Ancients, have you?&#x201d; Agrippa asked, returning me to the present.</p></p><h2>Decorating Is Fun!: How to be Your Own Decorator</h2><p><ul><li>A beautiful reproduction of the original book published in 1939 </li><li>Filled with tips, advice and anecdotes on decorating that still ring true today </li><li>A must-have for fans and followers of both Dorothy Draper and Carleton Varney </li></ul><p>After being out of print for many years, Decorating is Fun is being republished with its original illustrations and a new introduction by Draper's prot�g�, designer Carleton Varney.

Shalom, the Hebrew word often translated as "peace," was a far cry from blogger and podcaster Osheta Moore's crazy life. Like a lot of women, she loved God's dream for a world that is whole, vibrant, and flourishing. But honestly: who's got the time? So one night she whispered a dangerous prayer: God, show me the things that make for peace. In Shalom Sistas, Moore shares what she learned when she challenged herself to study peace in the Bible for forty days. Taking readers through the twelve points of the Shalom Sistas' Manifesto, Moore experiments with practices of everyday peacemaking and invites readers to do the same. From dropping "love bombs" on a family vacation, to talking to the coach who called her son the n-word, to spreading shalom with a Swiffer, Moore offers bold steps for crossing lines between black and white, suburban and urban, rich and poor. What if a bunch of Jesus-following women catch a vision of a vibrant, whole, flourishing world? What happens when Shalom Sistas unite?</p><p>Osheta Moore is a writer and podcaster in Los Angeles, as well as wife to an urban pastor, mother of three, and economic justice advocate for women in developing countries. Moore has consistently been a voice for peacemaking, justice, and racial reconciliation. Her work has been featured on numerous websites and blogs, including Sojourners, SheLoves Magazine, A Deeper Story, The Art of Simple, ReKnew, and Rachel Held Evans&#39; blog. Connect with her at Shalominthecity.com.<p> Moore, a podcaster and advocate, debuts with a passionate memoir and guidebook to living that is drawn from her experiences as a minister and activist. In 2005 Moore was doing community development work in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina forced her to relocate to Boston. After losing all of her possessions, she had a spiritual reawakening and decided to forge a new identity as a shalom sista : a peacemaker grounded in love, not fear. For herself and other followers of Christ who seek peace on Earth, Moore presents a 12-part manifesto that advocates choosing subversive joy, serving before speaking, and telling better stories. She explains how to deepen everyday spirituality through stories of her own life as a black minister and podcaster married to a white minister and raising their three children; through revisiting her blogged essays; and through Bible stories applied to contemporary political situations. With sass, common sense, humor, and wisdom, Moore embraces mothering and sistering, provides recipes, and decries racism. Through all these diverse threads, the book doesn t become unwieldy. Fans of Elizabeth Cunningham, Anne Lamott, and Nadia Bolz-Weber will be delighted with this new, exciting voice. </p><br><p><strong> <em>Publishers Weekly </em>starred review</strong></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p> You are going to love Osheta Moore.

On an unusually warm January morning in 1888, Sarah and her little sister, Annie, walk from their prairie farmhouse to their one-room, sod schoolhouse. At lunchtime, the temperature drops and a blizzard roars in, lifting part of the roof off the school. Their teacher ties each of the 16 students to a rope and leads them to her home, half a mile through the blinding, treacherous snowstorm. In an afterword, Figley notes that during the actual Nebraska storm known as the Schoolchildren's Blizzard, "many children died on their way home from school." The realistic interplay between Sarah and Annie will draw young readers into this simple, vivid story of natural catastrophe and native courage. Haas' paintings colorfully depict the changing weather as well as shifting emotions of the characters. Printed in large type with plenty of white space, this tale from the On My Own History series makes an exciting, accessible addition to the easy-reading shelves and a prime candidate for primary-grade assignments of fiction based on natural disasters. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Employing the Gill-Cartwright signature style of mingling fiction and fact, this book is brimming with fun and fascinating information and wonder about the tallest, coldest, wildest mountain in America.

As the tallest mountain in North America, Denali, or Mount McKinley, has its own unique ecosystem. To start, Gill gives two explanations of the mountain's origins, including the scientific and the Athabascan Indian legend. The shortness of the scientific explanation of Denali's geology will likely confuse young readers. However, most of the pages in this picture book are devoted to the plants and animals that live on or near the mountain, and these anecdote-filled accounts will spark plenty of interest. Cartwright supplies slightly cartoonish watercolor illustrations in double-page spreads that show the plants and animals with a certain amount of sly humor. Each of the layouts also features informative borders with additional pictures and facts on topics such as the yearly growth of a moose's antlers, wildflowers from the mountain meadows, or the fish of the mountain streams. Pages on animal tracks and scat are also included.

He now lives in California.<b>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>"What the Hell Am I Doing Here?"</b><br><br>The date was June 6, 1968. These were turbulent times in America. Splattered across the front page of every major newspaper were the ominous signs of social discontent. The mass anarchy and student unrest on college campuses around the country were at an all-time high. The chaos and disorder were largely due to the Vietnam War. As a nation, we were in mourning. The day before we'd lost another great leader, as Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down in the hotel kitchen of the old Coconut Grove in downtown Los Angeles.<br><br>Somehow I knew he would never become president, even though he was the front-runner during most of the presidential primaries. It was the "one" time I hated being right about a premonition. Still fresh in my mind was the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who had been assassinated on his motel balcony in Memphis, Tennessee, just a few weeks before. These assassinations were a clear indication that a network of social demons was staunchly in place and working at full force.<br><br>I was en route to Southeast Asia. Destination, the Republic of South Vietnam! My eight months of infantry training resulted in my being flown across the Pacific Ocean to a place that would change my life forever.<br><br>Around 1100 hours, and after almost twenty hours of flying time with a few stops along the way, the Pam Am 727 jetliner made an effortless landing at Bien Hoa Airport, Vietnam. There was no turning back now. We were already here.<br><br>In 1968, I was just out of high school, a confused black male living in a world that was coming apart at the seams. Many bizarre historical events happened in my young lifetime, such as my witnessing firsthand the Watts riot, surviving the fears of the Cuban missile crisis, the constant threat of nuclear war, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.<br><br>I began to embrace the conclusion that Western civilization was doomed to collapse or revert to barbarism, and we had no genuine chance of a reasonable future. Life had lost its value.<br><br>Now, I had put myself in a position to engage in the most extreme episode of my life, three years of duty in the military. I had little wisdom regarding the military, or what I was doing by enlisting in the army. But I'd made up my mind, and whatever field I chose, I was going all the way no matter the outcome. I put myself into this mess, now it was up to me to make the best of it.<br><br>The 250 GIs aboard the jetliner sat quietly, waiting for the aircraft to taxi to a halt. I peered nervously outside the port window. At that moment, home seemed so far away. Vietnam is about as far from home as an American can be while still on earth. Before I had enlisted in the army, I had never taken a trip outside the state of California. Now I was on the other side of the world, landing in a country where I might be asked to forfeit my life. I felt totally intimidated.<br><br>As I sat gazing beyond the window at the new and unfamiliar surroundings, I realized that, once outside the cabin of that airplane, whatever clumsy misconceptions I had about the country of Vietnam and the war in general would soon change. I began to silently question my basic training instructors' knowledge on the subject of Vietnam. Most of my infantry training on Vietnam had been followed by conflicting stories and rumors that were hard to swallow. I was never sure if some of the instructors in basic training, advanced airborne infantry training, and airborne jump school had ever fired a bullet in anger.<br><br>Or if any of them had ever made the trip to the land tagged as "hell on earth." The instructors who wore the CIB (Combat Infantry Badge) with a star over the top, well, you just knew to listen to them. For those with none at all, I had a raised eyebrow.<br><br>One story that continued to persist, and at the same time that I continued to reject, was the rumor that the enemy didn't go down after getting hit by bullets. The reports claimed that the enemy were so doped up on drugs that they didn't respond to getting shot. Yeah, right . . . How could I tell who was telling the truth and who wasn't?<br><br>I couldn't help but question whether or not I was ready to endure and survive the coming year. Would I be able to find the inner strength and fortitude?<br><br>Like most other kids growing up as a "baby boomer" during the John Wayne World War II movie era, I would romanticize what it would be like to fight and survive a war. It was my childish thirst for adventure and unyielding lust for knowledge that steered me this way in the first place.<br><br>Today a person might ask, what series of events could actually lead a person to volunteer to go fight a war? Well, for me that answer would be unequivocally, "Peer pressure and pride," plain and simple!<br><br>I remember a bright, sunny California Sunday afternoon. The song "Groovin' " by the Rascals played repeatedly on the old record player. My cousin Ricky Riley and I, with four of my closest friends, Gerald Burton, George Wallace, Jr., Owen Hampton (Le Le), and Lester Young, all got together to decide our future after high school. The general consensus leaned toward a three-year hitch with Uncle Sam. Ricky and Gerald wanted to serve with the U.S. Marines because of their family ties with the Corps. Le Le and Lester opted to go into the air force for their aeronautical training programs. I was wrangled into choosing a service because I had no intentions whatsoever of going into the military. But making my decision was easy. The army, airborne training, and the Special Forces schools had always piqued my interest. It really wasn't a bad deal considering I would be able to attend college on the GI Bill after completing my duty.<br><br>On occasion the military would show up at our high schools on career day. They offered an appealing assortment of training programs. On the other hand, I wanted to make a run at junior college football. As fate would have it, while training to make the football team at Harbor City College that summer, I broke my leg in a scrimmage. So during the frosty winter month of November 1967, just after my leg had healed, I joined the U.S. Army under the "buddy plan" with my high school best friend, George Wallace, Jr.<br><br>For obvious reasons we made quite a pair. We stuck together at a time when it wasn't easy for a black man in the Deep South to answer to a name like George Wallace, Jr.<br><br>It certainly was a challenge for poor George, and for me, too. With my "tough guy" attitude, I believed I could do just about anything, and George and I really got our fill of things. We were often the subject of sometimes funny and harmless ridicule administered by the drill instructors. It made life in the military just a little more interesting.<br><br>Now I would be the first to admit that it would not have gone over very well if most of my friends went off to war and I was the only one left behind. In our eclectic little circle you were either for the Vietnam War or you did something about it, like join a protest group or actively dodge the draft. I was never one who could stand on the sidelines and watch a good fight, so inevitably I joined the military to try and satisfy my passion for adventure.<br><br>While the rest of the world made deep, socially conscious decisions concerning their future and the state of the nation, I traveled the paths resolved by peer pressure and superficial football injuries. Obviously, I wasn't alone in my quest.<br><br>I tried to understand or even come to grips with the gravity of my decision, but I really had no idea what I was getting myself into by fighting a war. War wasn't at all what I'd expected it to be. War breeds an environment where every level of fear known to man will eventually surface.<br><br>First of all, I had to dig deep and draw out the courage it would take to leave home for the first time in my life. The other part of my self-imposed journey was joining the frightening and complex world of the U.S. military. Perhaps my journey was a cry for help, an effort to prove to myself and others, like my father, my self-worth. At the tender age of eighteen and nineteen years old, a teenager's hormones are overactive. My making a potentially suicidal statement like volunteering to fight in a war was in reality my reaching out and pleading, "Please stop me before I kill myself!"<br><br>It was too late now. My test of courage had me and the jetliner full of troops steadfastly on the runway awaiting instructions. The cabin inside the jetliner started to heat up. The overhead fans began blowing recirculated warm air. The now anxious and irritated cargo of GIs commenced to voice their collected opinions. Finally the door swung open, sucking out what was left of the precious "American" oxygen. The 250 passengers expressed a big sigh of relief from the stale air and heat. Soon after, the stewardess hustled us off the airplane with a courteous but repetitious "Bye bye" and "Good luck."<br><br>A line of buses waited to transport the troops to the 90th Replacement Center in Long Binh. When we boarded the bus, the interior was as warm as an oven. What a contrast to eighteen hours of pure comfort in a climate-controlled jetliner.<br><br>The windows inside the bus were half down and protected by a thick-gauge wire mesh screen to prevent the enemy from throwing hand grenades into the cargo area. Me being one of the cargo, I thought it was a good idea to have such protection.<br><br>The procession of buses weaved into the heavy traffic on a two-lane asphalt highway. The roads seemed well kept. Vietnam had a stench all its own, both politically and physically. The smell inside the city of Bien Hoa was like nothing I had ever experienced. The exposed sewer system that ran through the city streets gave off a damp, musty odor that made me want to puke.<br><br>Bien Hoa was a small, bustling rural town with a collection of U.S. and Vietnamese military personnel serving to protect its inhabitants. The motorbikes, taxis, Lambrettas, street vendors, and military vehicles made up a hefty portion of the traffic.<br><br>The "ladies of the night" had an American flair in their dress style, probably an enemy attempt to make us feel homesick. And it worked! There was no indication of a war inside the city except for the crush of military personnel roaming the streets. The city's merchants and civilians throughout the energetic marketplace seemed to go about their daily routine as if no war existed.<br><br>The caravan of brown army buses came to a stop in front of the personnel processing station. The hydraulic doors swung open revealing a short, burly "leg" (nonairborne) staff sergeant who started out by announcing his name and his height, so I thought.<br><br>"I am Staff Sergeant Robinson, and I am 'short'!"<br><br>"No kidding," I thought, snickering to myself at his five-foot-six squatty frame.<br><br>"I have only forty days left in this hellhole. Because I am so 'short,' I am in charge of you and this detail. I want you to think of me as God. Until I get on one of those big beautiful birds going home, you will obey and follow my every command!"<br><br>He ordered us off the bus to stand formation. When I stepped out into the intense heat, it was truly a rude awakening from hell. The scorching sun overcame me. It must've been every bit of 120 degrees. A thick wave of heat blanketed the long road leading to the rest of the base area. I was almost certain I was in purgatory. The sweat from my body consumed my fatigues. "Oh shit!" I thought. "This fuckin' place is hot as hell and humid, too! Boy, Ed, you really screwed up this time. You and your big ideas about facing your fears and showing the world you could handle whatever life dished out. . . ."<br><br>Staff Sergeant Robinson instructed us to stand at ease.<br><br>"Smoke 'em if you got 'em."<br><br>"What? Is he joking?" I said, complaining to the person next to me. Who in their right mind would smoke a cigarette in this heat? To light a cigarette, all you had to do was hold it up to the sun and poof, instant fire!<br><br>"When you finish your smoke break," the staff sergeant continued, "field strip the cigarettes and stuff the butts into your pockets, because you are the ones who will be policing this area."<br><br>It was a struggle to get adjusted to the new weather conditions. It took two full sweaty days just to learn how to breathe the thick heavy air.<br><br>During my first few days at the holding center, I had to pull the unpopular details like KP and perimeter guard duty. We also had to attend mandatory formations and orientations. On the third day we were paid our military salary and issued our much valued ration cards. A large air force PX was nearby on base, and believe me when I say this, getting the ration cards was like receiving the key to the city. We were given time off and dismissed from formation to go raise hell. I joined a group of guys with a jeep headed to the PX. I bought enough goodies and supplies to keep me "in pocket" for a long while. We had no idea when we would be able to visit a military store again.<br><br>For the sake of keeping track of time while pulling guard duty on the perimeter berm, I purchased a durable Casio watch with an illuminated dial. There were times when disputes surfaced in the middle of the night or early morning because the common watch that was supposed to be passed every two hours didn't make it. Some of the troops couldn't stay awake for two and four hours at a time and frequently fell asleep during their guard shift. They would then try to pass the blame and the remaining time on to you or to whomever was next in line. It was smart to have your own watch at all times.</p><h2>When Kingdoms Clash: Strategies for Prayer in the Heat of Battle</h2><p><b>Harness the power of prayer</b><br> The front lines of the clash between the kingdoms of darkness and light do not usually happen in our churches; they happen in our lives--in our workplaces, neighborhoods, where our children go to school, in our voting booths, and in the halls of influence.

"Ted" Shackley in December 2002 triggered an avalanche of obituaries from all over the world, some of them condemnatory. Pundits used such expressions as "heroin trafficking," "training terrorists," "attempts to assassinate Castro," and "Mob connections." More specifically, they charged him with having played a major role in the Chilean military coup of 1973.But who was the real Ted Shackley? In <i>Spymaster</i>, he has told the story of his entire remarkable career for the first time. With the assistance of fellow former CIA officer Richard A. Finney, he discusses the consequential posts he held in Berlin, Miami, Laos, Vietnam, and Washington, where he was intimately involved in some of the key intelligence operations of the Cold War. During his long career, Shackley ran part of the inter-agency program to overthrow Castro, was chief of station in Vientiane during the CIA's "secret war" against North Vietnam and the Pathet Lao, and was chief of station in Saigon. After his retirement, he remained a controversial figure. In the early eighties, he was falsely charged with complicity in the Iran-Contra scandal. Ted Shackley's comments on CIA operations in Europe, Cuba, Chile, and Southeast Asia and on the life of a high-stakes spymaster will be the subject of intense scrutiny by all concerned with the fields of intelligence, foreign policy, and postwar U.S. history.</p><p>Ted Shackley&#39;s final CIA position was as associate deputy director for operations. He died in December 2002, weeks after completing this book."A veritable handbook for spies."&#x2014;From the foreword by B. Hugh Tovar, former head of CIA Covert Action and Counterintelligence Staffs (B. Hugh Tovar)<br><br>"An incisive and important account by an authentic intelligence professional about the evolution of intelligence and covert action in a changing world. Shackley&#x2019;s descriptions are riveting, and as far back as 1992, he called for a director of national intelligence and fingered terrorism as a priority problem. Every aspiring intelligence officer and anyone interested in the realities of intelligence should read this book."&#x2014;James R. Lilley, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and China (James R. Lilley)<br><br>"A must read for espionage and intelligence buffs and one that the uninitiated will appreciate as well. For example, Shackley offers a dispassionate but gripping insider's account of CIA activities leading up to the delivery of the Soviet missiles to Cuba, the CIA&#x2019;s confirmation of their presence, and the Kennedy-Khrushchev agreement that ended the crisis. It&#x2019;s an account that once again brings home just how close the episode came to converting the Cold War into a hot one, with its potentially apocalyptic consequences."&#x2014;Don Bohning, author of <i>The Castro Obsession: U.S. Covert Operations Against Cuba, 1959-1965</i> (Don Bohning)<br><br>"Provides details important to understanding many Cold War crises, and peels back the cloak-and-dagger CIA image to reveal that collecting and analyzing intelligence is a tough intellectual task not for the faint of heart or mind. It also clearly demonstrates the critical need for human intelligence collection and its ability, if properly analyzed, to provide advance warning to policymakers to prevent surprises. Following the surprise of 9/11, policymakers and citizens could learn much about the value of human intelligence collection and about the responsibilities of a Cold War spy by reading this senior spymaster&#x2019;s revealing memoirs."&#x2014;Dr. Jane Hamilton-Merritt, author of <i>Tragic Mountains: The Hmong, the Americans, and the Secret War for Laos</i> (Dr. Jane Hamilton-Merritt)<br><br>"Offers considerable miitary detail from the proverbial horse's mouth."&#x2014;<i>Military Periscope</i> (<i>Military Periscope</i>)<br><br>"Lively and informative . . .

Levine introduce three aspects of New Testament study: the world of the text (plots, characters, setting, and themes), the world behind the text (the concerns, circumstances, and experiences of the early Christian communities), and the world in front of the text (the meaning for contemporary readers).&nbsp;As students engage the New Testament, they&nbsp;face a central issue that has confronted all students before them, namely, that these texts have been and are read in diverse and often quite conflicting ways. These multiple readings&nbsp;involve different methods: historical-critical, traditional (history of interpretation), colonial, multicultural, and sociological, with feminist and liberationist implications for the first-century readers as well as the ongoing implications for today's reader. For example, Carter and Levine&nbsp;show how a text can be used by both colonizer and colonized, feminist&nbsp;and anti-feminist, or pro- and anti-Jewish.&nbsp;The authors also show&nbsp;how scholarly work can be both constructive and threatening&nbsp;to the contemporary Church and how polemical texts can be used, whether for religious study, theological reflection, or homiletical practice.</p> <p>"... a brilliant contemporary representative of the biblical discipline of the&nbsp;<em>Einleitung, </em>Introduction. ... In the best tradition of historical-critical biblical scholarship, Carter and Levine advocate a respectful, critical and generous engagement with the texts, involving readers in finding meanings. ... There are many gems in the heart of this book, including excursuses in shaded boxes, and some misguided traditional interpretations are safely despatched.&nbsp; Dagmar Winter, Journal for the Study of The New Testament Booklist 2015</p></p><p>Warren Carter is Professor of New Testament at Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth, with a Ph.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary.

Smith, the 55-year-old daughter of Irish immigrants, had spent the last decade and a half fighting for the rights of female workers. But now all of her worries about their health and well-being were focused on one wildly popular mechanical object: the bicycle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bicycling by young women has helped to swell the ranks of reckless girls who finally drift into the standing army of outcast women of the United States,&#x201d; wrote Smith in a resolution issued by her group, the Women&#x2019;s Rescue League. &#x201c;The bicycle is the devil&#x2019;s advance agent morally and physically in thousands of instances.&#x201d; Smith&#x2019;s resolution called for &#x201c;all true women and clergymen&#x201d; to join with her in denouncing the bicycle craze among women as &#x201c;indecent and vulgar.&#x201d; She set her sights on New York City as the laboratory for her reform efforts, opening a branch of her Washington-based organization there with the goal of ultimately limiting the use of the bicycle by women. <br> &nbsp;<br> Smith blamed the bicycle for the downfall of women&#x2019;s health, morals, and religious devotion. Her accusations brought a swift and impassioned response. The Reverend Dr. A. Stewart Walsh, a respected clergyman in New York City and a cyclist himself, wrote a letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle declaring. &#x201c;I have associated with thousands of riders...and I have not seen among them . . . anything that could begin to approach the outrageous and scandalous indecency of the resolutions of the alleged rescue league.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ellen B. Parkhurst, wife of another New York minister, celebrated the advantages of bicycle riding in Washington&#x2019;s Evening Times. &#x201c;Of course I do not believe that bicycling is immoral,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A girl who rides a wheel is lifted out of herself and her surroundings. She is made to breathe purer air, see fresher and more beautiful scenes, and get an amount of exercise she would not otherwise get. All this is highly beneficial.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In fact, the impact of the bicycle on the health and welfare of its riders was the subject of a great deal of discussion in the 1890s. At first, the popularity of the safety drew mostly praise as its use seemed to usher in a new era of robust living. Medical literature linked cycling to cures for everything from asthma and diabetes to heart disease and varicose veins, while one study credited the decreasing death rate from consumption (tuberculosis) among women in Massachusetts to their increasing use of the bicycle. Cigar sales took a hit &#x2014; one industry estimate suggested people were buying as many as one million fewer cigars per day &#x2014; because cyclists were too busy exercising to indulge in the smoking habit. And in Chicago, bicycling evidently caused a drop in the use of the painkiller morphine. &#x201c;The morphine takers have discovered that a long spin in the fresh air on a cycle induces sweet sleep better than their favorite drug,&#x201d; reported the British Medical Journal in November 1895.</p><h2>This Little Light: Beyond a Baptist Preacher Predator and His Gang</h2><p>In this groundbreaking memoir and expos�, Christa Brown tells the story of clergy sex abuse and cover-ups in the largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. As she shares her journey from trusting church girl to tenacious advocate for children&#39;s safety, Brown shines a light on the patterns of preacher-predators and the collusion of evangelical leaders. This Little Light speaks of the unspeakable, and in doing so, testifies to the transformative power of truth-telling.</p><p>Told from the perspective of the church girl, the wife, the mom, and the activist, <i>This Little Light</i> is a story that attempts to speak of the unspeakable and to sort out its impact on mind, body and spirit. It is also a story of institutionalized inertia that cloaks evil behind a veil of denial. And it is a story of survivor empowerment that brings with it the hope for change.The decision to write this book did not come easily. Why in the world would I choose to speak publicly about something so unspeakable?

With these books, even note-dependent reading can continue virtually uninterrupted, making them ideal for following a recorded performance or reading aloud ... Although the books in this series were created for actors and directors, their sheer vivacity and user-friendliness makes them ideal for students and teachers too.

It also informs the practitioner about the underlying strength or weakness of the patient s constitution. This new edition of Atlas of Chinese Tongue Diagnosis contains over two hundred color photographs of tongues seen in a Western clinic. The photos provide a graphic representation of a wide variety of common disorders. Each photograph is accompanied by a description of the significant features of the tongue, the corresponding Chinese diagnosis for each feature, accompanying symptoms, Western diagnosis, and pertinent background information. The sequence of the photos within a chapter shows the increasing degree of imbalance among the body s energies. The presentation of the tongues is organized according to the nature of the underlying organ disharmony: Lungs, Spleen, Stomach, Kidney, Heart, Liver. Other chapters focus on particular aspects of the tongue such as pale tongues, cracked tongues, special coatings, as well as those associated with heat disorders and blood stasis. A final chapter surveys several cases that reflect how the tongue changed over the course of treatment, with before and after photographs. This systematic presentation provides the student and practitioner with a much deeper understanding of the methodology of tongue diagnosis in Chinese medicine. This new second edition of the Atlas combines and reconfigures the content of the two volumes in the original edition into one new, integrated volume. The new edition retains most of the photos from the first volume and a number of case histories from the second. A few new photos that are particularly good examples of specific tongue colors or other signs have also been added. At the same time, some of the photos and case histories in the original volumes have been discarded to enhance the readability of the book and thus make it more useful as a single volume reference work. An extensive and detailed index provides access to virtually every aspect of the hundreds of tongues presented in this atlas, and their interrelationships.</p><p>Barbara Kirschbaum received her Bachelor of Acupuncture at the International College of Oriental Medicine (England) in 1980, where she taught for seven years, and has pursued additional studies at various TCM hospitals in China.

Instead, Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, have stirred the wrath of those they&#39;ve thwarted, and they are now separated and on the run.</p><p><strong>Laurie R. King on <em>The God of the Hive</em></strong> <p> </p> <p>Basically, I have a low threshold for boredom. For a series writer this can be a dangerous thing, since any series is to some extent the same people doing things similar to what they did before. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve gotten around this by alternating one series with another, and tossing in the occasional standalone.</p> <p>But sometimes, I find myself writing the same characters that I did the previous year. Which is fine, I like my characters, and I can always find something for them to do. Even so, there is a faint air of threat in a second year with the same people, rather like having good friends to stay on an island retreat and having a really great time and wishing they could stay longer until the morning comes when they&#x2019;re scheduled to take off and the bridge is out, and your boat sinks, and a storm comes up and pretty soon they&#x2019;ve been there for a month and you begin to grumble and snap and wonder what the devil you ever saw in these parasites, and you eye the hatchet and the rat poison and...</p> <p>Because I know that I have a low threshold for the same faces, whenever I have characters who look as if they&#x2019;re going to stay on longer than I&#x2019;d originally intended, I arrange things so that we don&#x2019;t have a chance to get bored with each other. Little projects and changes of scenery help: plop the characters on a boat and send them to India, say, followed by something entirely different like San Francisco. And make the first one a spy thriller, and the second one more psychological suspense: hence <em>The Game</em> and <em>Locked Rooms</em>. Bring in a historical detective writer--Dashiell Hammett--and voila! No chance to wear on one another&#x2019;s nerves!</p> <p>Similarly, the team of players who come back from San Francisco onto ground that&#x2019;s been worked before--how many times can one write an English Country House Mystery?--needs to have something unexpected thrown at them, and at the faithful reader. You think you know the characters? Well, how about a long-lost son for Sherlock Holmes--and if that&#x2019;s not enough, maybe give him a granddaughter as well? Then for the following year, take the ingredients of <em>The Language of Bees</em> and change it from first person to multiple points of view, toss with a dash of modern espionage and a sprinkling of ancient British mythology, and pour them all out onto Westminster Bridge in the wee hours, and you have <i>The God of the Hive</i>.</p> <p>And next year, when the third Russell &amp; Holmes in a row comes out? I plan on--but no, let&#x2019;s let that be a surprise. Let us just say, what they will do is sufficiently different from <i>The God of the Hive</i> that it will save them from the dangers of an author&#x2019;s vengeful imagination: last time a writer got tired of Sherlock Holmes, it led to a dive off a high waterfall.</p> <br>Laurie R.

In the US, he&#x2019;s best known for his graphic adaptation of Michael Moorcock&#x2019;s <i>Elric</i> hit fantasy series, <i>Elric, the Return to Melnibone, </i>and his work for <i>Heavy Metal</i>, such as <i>City of Flowers.</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b>Gr 10 Up&#x2014;Lone Sloane finds himself, as the title suggests, adrift in solitude after his spacecraft explodes. Where most people would surely have perished, Sloane survives, managing to evade the all-consuming black hole that has seemingly erased any vestiges of his craft. In its place a stone throne emerges, thus beginning the very trippy voyages of the title character. Druillet's oversize picture book is a psychedelic fantasy reminiscent of the "Bronze Age" of comics (1970&#x2013;85). His use of worm's-eye perspective, warm colors, monochromatic patterns, and various shades of gray, black, and white capture Sloane's alternating position as the "hunted" and the "one touched by the King of Gods." Readers may find themselves confused by the bizarre surrealism of the illustrations, which occasionally might cause them to lose the story's focus. There isn't much revealed about the protagonist and how he came to be regarded as the sought after "living one," nor why he is a "loner" among his kin. Perhaps the answer to these questions and more will be found during subsequent voyages.

In the arid wilderness He planned to reveal His nature and ways to them, but they drew back. How different are we today? Many confess the Lordship of Jesus and acknowledge His saving power, yet like Israel, they've drawn back. Rather than pursuing His heart they have cleaved to this world's form of worship-the worship of self. As a result we have changed the image of Jesus to be like us. Fire can alter these images. The fire we need is found in the Holiness of God. God is calling us to draw nearer still...to tremble on Mt.

Visit her online at JenniferWeiner.com.Fly Away Home <br>SYLVIE<br> <br>Breakfast in five-star hotels was always the same. This was what Sylvie Serfer Woodruff thought as the elevator descended from the sixth floor and opened onto the gleaming expanse of the lobby of the Four Seasons in Philadelphia. After thirty-two years of marriage, fourteen of them as the wife of the senior senator from New York, after visits to six continents and some of the major cities of the world, perhaps she should have been able to come up with something more profound about human nature and common ground and the ties that bind us all, but there it was&#x2014;her very own insight. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it wasn&#x2019;t nothing. If pressed, Sylvie also had some very profound and trenchant observations to make about executive airport lounges.<br> <br>She took a deep breath, uncomfortably aware of the way the waistband of her skirt dug into her midriff. Then she slipped her hand into her husband&#x2019;s and walked beside him, past the reception desk toward the restaurant, thinking that it was a good thing, a reassuring thing, that no matter where you were, London or Los Angeles or Dubai, if you were in a good hotel, a Four Seasons or a Ritz-Carlton&#x2014;and, these days, when she and Richard traveled they were almost always in a Four Seasons or a Ritz-Carlton&#x2014;your breakfast would never surprise you.<br> <br>There would be menus, offered today by a girl in a trim black suit who stood behind a podium in the plushly carpeted entryway, beaming at the patrons as if their arrival represented the very pinnacle of her day and possibly of her lifetime. Richard would wave the menus away. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do the buffet,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d announce, without asking whether there was one. There always was. &#x201c;Of course, sir,&#x201d; their waiter or the maitre d&#x2019; or today&#x2019;s black-suited girl would murmur in approval. They&#x2019;d be led through a richly appointed room, past the heavy silk drapes, elaborately tassled and tied, past mahogany sideboards and expensively dressed diners murmuring over their coffee. Richard would deposit his briefcase and his newspapers at their table, and then they&#x2019;d proceed to the buffet.<br> <br>There&#x2019;d be an assortment of fresh fruit, slices of melon, peeled segments of grapefruit and orange and sliced kiwis, arranged like jewels on white china platters. There were always croissants, chocolate and plain, always muffins, bran and blueberry and corn, always bagels (yes, even in Dubai), always shot glasses layered with yogurt and muesli, always slices of bread and English muffins, arrayed next to a toaster, and chafing dishes of scrambled eggs and bacon and sausage and breakfast potatoes, and there was always a chef in a toque and a white jacket, making omelets. Richard would ask for an omelet (spinach, as a nod to health, and mushrooms and Cheddar cheese&#x2014;he liked onions, but couldn&#x2019;t risk a day of bad breath). Once the order was placed, he&#x2019;d hand off his plate to Sylvie and return to their table, to his New York Times and his Wall Street Journal and the eternal consolation of his BlackBerry, and Sylvie would wait for his food.<br> <br>The first time her mother, the Honorable Selma Serfer, had seen Sylvie perform this maneuver, she&#x2019;d stared at her daughter with her mouth open and a dot of Crimson Kiss lipstick staining her incisor. &#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked, in her grating Brooklyn accent. Sylvie had tried to shush her. Selma, as always, had refused to be shushed. &#x201c;Seriously, Sylvie? This is what you do? You fetch his eggs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s busy,&#x201d; Sylvie murmured, shifting the plate to her right hand and tucking a lock of hair behind her ear with her left. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; She knew what her mother was thinking without the Honorable Selma, first in her class (and one of seven women) at Yale Law, former chief judge of the state of New York, having to say a word. Sylvie should mind, and Sylvie should be busy, too. Like her mother, Sylvie had gone to Barnard and Yale. Sylvie was meant to have followed in Selma&#x2019;s footsteps straight up to the Supreme Court, or at the very least practiced law for more than two years. Selma and David Serfer&#x2019;s only child had been intended for better things than marriage, motherhood, committee work for various charities, and collecting her husband&#x2019;s breakfast.<br> <br>Ah, well, she thought, as the chef swirled melted butter in a pan. She was happy with her life, even if it didn&#x2019;t please her mother. She loved her husband, she respected what he&#x2019;d accomplished, she felt good about the part that she&#x2019;d played in his career. Besides, she knew it could be worse. In cities all over the world, women went hungry, were beaten or abused; women watched their children suffer. Sylvie had seen them, had touched their hands and bounced their babies on her lap. It seemed churlish to complain about the occasional small indignity, about the hours she&#x2019;d spent campaigning, face smoothed into a pleasant expression, mouth set in a smile, hair straightened into an inoffensive shoulder-length bob, wearing hose that squeezed her middle and pumps that pinched her toes, standing behind her husband, saying nothing.<br> <br>Normally, it didn&#x2019;t bother her, but every so often, discontent rose up inside her, spurred by some unpleasant reminder of her unrealized potential. A few months ago, the forms for her thirty-fifth reunion at Barnard had arrived in her in-box. There&#x2019;d been a survey, a series of questions about life after college. One of them was Tell us how you spend your time. If you&#x2019;re working, please describe your job. Before she could stop herself, Sylvie had typed My job is to stay on a diet so that I can fit into size-six St. John knit suits and none of the bloggers can say that my behind&#x2019;s getting big. She&#x2019;d erased the words immediately, replacing them with a paragraph about her volunteer work, the funds she raised for the homeless and the ballet, breast cancer research and the library and the Museum of Modern Art. She&#x2019;d added a sentence about her daughters: Diana, who was an emergency-room doctor right here in Philadelphia, and Lizzie, vexing Lizzie who&#x2019;d given them such heartache, now several months sober (she didn&#x2019;t mention that), with her hair restored to its original blond and all those horrible piercings practically closed. She&#x2019;d added a final beat about how for the last fourteen years she had been lucky enough to travel the world in the company of her husband, Senator Richard Woodruff, D-NY. But sometimes, late at night, she thought that the truth was the first thing she&#x2019;d written. Whatever ambition she&#x2019;d possessed, whatever the dreams she&#x2019;d once had, Sylvie Serfer Woodruff had grown up to be a fifty-seven-year-old professional dieter, a woman whose only real job now that her daughters were gone was staying twenty pounds thinner than she&#x2019;d been in law school.<br> <br>So she&#x2019;d lost herself a little bit, she thought, as the chef sprinkled cheese into the pan. So life hadn&#x2019;t been perfect; bad things had happened, mistakes had been made. But hadn&#x2019;t they built something together, she and Richard, and Lizzie and Diana, and wasn&#x2019;t that more important, more meaningful, than anything Sylvie could have done on her own? What kind of career would she have had, anyhow? She wasn&#x2019;t as good a lawyer as her mother. She might have been quick, and smart and well-read, but her mind wasn&#x2019;t built to spring and snap shut like a trap the way her mother&#x2019;s was. She could admit, if only to herself, that she was bright but not terribly ambitious; that she lacked a certain something, aggression or tenacity or even just desire, that magical quality that would have lifted her from good to great. But she&#x2019;d found a place for herself in the world. She&#x2019;d raised her girls and been a help to her husband, a sounding board and a concierge, a scheduler and a speechwriter, a traveling companion and a co-campaigner. So what if every once in a while late at night she felt like all she had to show for her years on the planet were miles logged on a treadmill that took her nowhere and a number on the scale that was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain? So what if...<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; The chef was staring at her, spatula raised. The omelet sat in a perfectly browned half-circle in the center of the pan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said, and held out the empty plate toward him like an orphan in a Dickens novel, an orphan asking for more.<br> <br>He slid the omelet onto the plate. Sylvie collected the slices of whole-wheat bread she&#x2019;d popped into the toaster. She added a pat of butter, a pot of marmalade, the wedges of cantaloupe that Richard would ignore, and a single slice of bacon, well-done, the way he preferred it (he&#x2019;d want more than one slice, but there was his heart to consider). Richard was reading the Op-Ed page and talking on his phone, with a cup of coffee steaming at his elbow, so busy multitasking that he barely looked up. She set his food in front of him and tapped his shoulder. &#x201c;Eat,&#x201d; she said, and Richard smiled, put his arm around her waist, and gave her a quick squeeze.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, dear,&#x201d; he said, and she said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; then went back to gather her own joyless meal: fat-free yogurt, a single stewed prune, a mini-box of Special K, a glass of skim milk, and, as her reward, a scoop of the oatmeal she could never resist, deliciously creamy, the way it never got at home. She&#x2019;d add a little butter, a swirl of brown sugar, a splash of cream, turning it into something that was more like pudding than breakfast.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d eaten only a few bites when Richard dropped his crumpled napkin over the remains of his eggs. He&#x2019;d ignored the fruit, as she predicted, and the bacon was gone, the way she knew it would be. &#x201c;All set?&#x201d; he asked. She wasn&#x2019;t. But she nodded, rising as he stood, gripping the starchy elbows of his suit jacket as he kissed her, lightly, on the lips. Her schedule was in a manila folder, tucked into her purse, and had been beamed to her iPhone as a backup, along with her speech. Richard would be attending a fund-raising coffee for a state senator, a rising star in the party who was being groomed for bigger things. This would be followed by a lunch at the convention center with CEOs of some of the nation&#x2019;s largest hospitals, bigwigs looking for breaks on the import taxes they&#x2019;d pay to have their MRI machines assembled in Japan. Meanwhile, Sylvie, who hated public speaking, would be locking her shaking knees, hiding her sweating palms, and delivering an address to the Colonial Dames, a Philadelphia variation of the Junior League, about how, if each of them gave just what she spent each month on highlights and lattes to the Free Library, they could buy hundreds of books and expose thousands of children to the joys of stories. It was a speech she&#x2019;d given dozens of times and would doubtless give dozens of times more before her husband&#x2019;s third term ended in four years. And after that? &#x201c;Sky&#x2019;s the limit,&#x201d; Richard used to say, when they were young and dreaming, lying on the flimsy mattress in their apartment on Court Street in Brooklyn, where the floors tilted so severely that if you put anything round down against one wall it would roll to the other side of the room.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d lived in Brooklyn back when telling people your address made them treat you with the solicitous courtesy they&#x2019;d extend to pioneers who&#x2019;d just set off west in a covered wagon. Back then, Richard owned two suits, one navy blue and one brown, both purchased at an end-of-season clearance sale at Bloomingdale&#x2019;s and paid for, in part, with a gift certificate that Sylvie&#x2019;s parents had given her for Chanukah to buy her own working-girl wardrobe. He would rotate his suits Monday through Friday&#x2014;blue, brown, blue, brown, blue&#x2014;and on Saturdays, he&#x2019;d drop them off at the cleaner&#x2019;s. Every morning they&#x2019;d walk to the subway together, and Sylvie would follow him down the stairs, thinking how lucky she was to have found this man, her Richard&#x2014;slim-hipped, broad-shouldered, his light-brown hair thick and unruly, no matter how carefully he combed it, the hair of a little boy who&#x2019;d just rolled out of bed, with his briefcase swinging jauntily in one hand. That&#x2019;s my husband, she would think. She&#x2019;d want to shout it to the sky, or at least to the other women she&#x2019;d catch looking him over, their eyes making the drop from his face to his ring finger. My husband. Mine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Husband,&#x201d; she whispered, standing on her tiptoes (Richard was nine inches taller than she was, a solid six foot three, a presidential height, she sometimes thought) and letting her lips graze his ear. Almost imperceptibly, he shuddered. &#x201c;Wife,&#x201d; he whispered back. Richard had always been ticklish. In bed, she&#x2019;d drag the tip of her tongue along the edge of his ear, nipping at the lobe with her teeth, and he&#x2019;d tremble, muttering her name. At least, he used to. Sylvie frowned, or attempted a frown&#x2014;the Botox she&#x2019;d gotten the week before was making it hard to furrow her brow&#x2014;and tried to remember how long it had been. Over the past months&#x2014;maybe even the past years&#x2014;things had slowed down, not in an alarming fashion, but in a manner that Sylvie had come to believe was normal for long-married couples. They made love once or twice a week, sometimes with dry spells of a week or two (or three, or four) when Congress was in session and Richard spent the weeknights in the rented townhouse in Georgetown. She missed it sometimes, but she thought that the kind of sex they&#x2019;d had at the beginning&#x2014;every night, sometimes twice a night, once in the thankfully empty sauna at a resort where they&#x2019;d gone for a law school classmate&#x2019;s wedding&#x2014;that was the sex you had in the early days, and then things settled down, they had to, or else how would anyone get any work done, or raise children?<br> <br>Richard gave her a squeeze and planted another kiss in the center of her paralyzed, poisonous brow (perfectly safe, the dermatologist had assured her when he&#x2019;d come to the apartment with his doctor&#x2019;s bag full of needles and his mouth full of reassurance). &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you tonight,&#x201d; he said. Sylvie watched him walk out of the restaurant, BlackBerry in one hand, briefcase in the other, through the lobby and then out to the curb, where a car would be waiting, the way, these days, a car always was. My husband, she thought, and her heart swelled, the way it had when she was a young bride watching Richard descend into the depths of the subway station, ready to rule the world.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>She was in the backseat of her own Town Car by four o&#x2019;clock, an issue of The Economist open in her lap, reading the latest news from the Middle East as the car crawled through a five-mile backup on the New Jersey Turnpike. The region was clenched in a typical August heat wave, the air a humid steambath that left everyone sticky and ill-tempered after even the briefest venture outside. She was planning her movements, how she&#x2019;d exit the car and enter her apartment building with the least time possible spent in the humidity&#x2014;she had a cocktail party to attend, and she didn&#x2019;t want to have to redo her hair&#x2014;when her cell phone rang. Or, rather, her cell phone belched. Lizzie, her youngest, had set it up so it would burp instead of ring, and Sylvie hadn&#x2019;t been able to figure out how to make it stop. The phone burped again, and her best friend Ceil&#x2019;s face flashed on the screen. In the picture, which Sylvie had taken outside the Buttercup Bakery, Ceil was devouring a red velvet cupcake, and had a dab of frosting on her nose. Sylvie had snapped it and had threatened to post it on Facebook. Not that she completely understood how Facebook worked, or had any idea of how to post things there. The threat alone had been enough to make Ceil laugh. As she hit the button to answer the call, Sylvie noticed two missed calls, both from Richard....</p><h2>Fortune Teller and Dreamer&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>Originally published in 1863, <i>The Fortune Teller and Dreamer's Dictionary</i> by Madame LeMarchand&#x2015;a "celebrated Parisian fortune teller"&#x2015;is a little gem of occult knowledge. Readers will learn to tell fortunes using dice or ordinary playing cards, read tea leaves and coffee grounds, interpret dreams, make charms, read palms, and much, much more. The contents include the "Lady's Love Oracle," as well as the "Art of discovering Truth from Falsehood, Augury of the Flower, Charms and Ceremonies, and How to tell fortunes by Moles." There are also instructions for telling a person's character by assigning numerical values to the letters in his or her name, adding the numbers, and referring to the number in the book's chart. Filled with diagrams and illustrations to supplement and clarify the written text, this is a reissue of a rare and unusual Civil War-era book.</p><p>All we know about Madame Le Marchand is what is found on the book&#39;s title page; she was, it says, a &#34;Celebrated Parisian Fortune Teller.&#34;</p><h2>Khordeh Avesta</h2><p>The oldest Zoroastrian religious scripture, handed down from ancient times, is the Avesta. One section of the holy book is known as the &#34;Khordeh Avesta&#34; or &#34;Smaller (i.e. Selected) Avesta&#34;. This is the book of daily prayers of the Zoroastrians, including the most sacred prayers or manthras, as well as graces said over meals and other occasions, blessings, and hymns to spiritual beings. It is a cherished possession of every devout Zoroastrian household. Zoroastrians recite their prayers in a sacred language known as Avestan. The celebrated Avesta scholar and priest (Ervad) Kavasji Edulji Kanga prepared an edition of this prayer book in 1880 A.D., with Gujarati translation. An English edition was first printed in 1993, which has become very scarce. Due to the popularity of Kanga&#39;s editions, and the accuracy of its pronunciation, this new printed edition was prepared, correcting the frequent printer&#39;s errors found in the 1993 edition.</p><p></p><h2>American Sniper: Memorial Edition</h2><p><p>The #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling memoir of U.S. Navy Seal Chris Kyle, and the source for Clint Eastwood&#x2019;s blockbuster movie which was nominated for six academy awards, including best picture.</p><p>From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most career sniper kills in United States military history.

Lee, and Young-Ha Kim, among others. She lives in Los Angeles.The smell of blood woke me. It was intense, as though my whole body were inhaling it. It reverberated and expanded within me. Strange scenes flitted through my mind&#x2014;the fuzzy yellow light of a row of street lamps in the fog, swirling water below my feet, a crimson umbrella rolling along a rain-soaked road, a plastic tarpaulin shrouding a construction site snapping in the wind. Somewhere a man was singing and slurring lyrics: a song about a girl he couldn&#x2019;t forget, and about her walking in the rain. <br><br> It didn&#x2019;t take me long to figure out what was going on. None of this was reality or even the remnants of a dream. It was a signal my head was sending my body. Stay lying down. Don&#x2019;t move. It&#x2019;s the price you have to pay for not taking your medication. <br><br> Not taking my meds was a quenching rain in the desert of my life, even if it sometimes caused a seizure. Right now, I was experiencing the unsettling hallucinations that warned me a storm was imminent. There was no safe harbor; I could only wait for it to arrive. If past experience was any indication, when it was over, I wouldn&#x2019;t remember what had happened. It would be simple and intense, and afterward I would be tired and depleted. I deserved this; I knew full well what I was getting into when I chose this path. It was an addiction; I kept doing it again and again despite understanding the risks. Most addicts get high to chase after a fantasy, but for me it was a different route: I had to get <i>off </i>my drugs to reach a heightened reality. That was when the magic hours opened up&#x2014;my headaches and tinnitus disappeared, and my senses became acute. I could smell like a dog, my brain whirred quicker than ever, and I read the world by instinct instead of with reason. I felt empowered and superior.<br><br> Even then, I still had tiny dissatisfactions. I never felt superior to Mother and Auntie. These two women treated me like a seat cushion&#x2014;something to be suffocated and smothered. I knew what the chain of events would be if Mother were to witness me having a seizure. As soon as I recovered, she would drag me straight to Auntie, the famous psychiatrist and director of Future Pediatric Clinic. Auntie would look into my eyes and talk to me kindly to try to get me to listen to her. <i>Why did you stop taking your pills? Tell me honestly, so I can help you. </i>Frankly, though, honesty is neither my strong suit nor something I aspire to. I prefer to be practical, so my answer would be: <i>I forgot to take it one day, then the next day I forgot that I&#x2019;d forgotten the day before, and while I&#x2019;m at it, why don&#x2019;t I just say that I&#x2019;ve forgotten about it every day until this very moment? </i>Auntie would declare that I was falling into another dangerous pattern, and Mother would order me to take the pills at each meal under observation. They would drill into me the steep price I would pay for a few thrilling days, making it clear that as long as I continued to behave this way, I would never be free of their gaze.<br><br> &#x201c;Yu-jin.&#x201d; Suddenly Mother&#x2019;s voice popped into my head. I had heard it, soft but clear, right before I woke up. But now I couldn&#x2019;t even hear her moving about downstairs. It was so quiet. A deafening stillness. It was dark in my room; maybe it was still early, before the sun was up. She might still be asleep. Then I could have this seizure and be done with it without her having to know about it, like last night. Around midnight, I&#x2019;d stood panting near the sea wall on my way back from a run to the Milky Way Observatory in Gundo Marine Park. I ran when I got restless and felt my muscles twitching with energy. I thought of it as &#x201c;restless body syndrome.&#x201d; Sometimes I ran in the middle of the night; it wouldn&#x2019;t be exaggerating to call it a mad urge.<br><br> The streets were deserted, as they always were at that hour. Yongi&#x2019;s, the street stall that sold sugar-filled pancakes, was closed. The ferry dock below was shrouded in darkness. Thick fog had swallowed the six-lane road by the sea wall. The December wind was biting and powerful, and a torrential rain was falling. Most would consider these adverse conditions, but I felt as though I was floating in the air. I felt fantastic. I could float all the way home. It would have been perfect if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the sweet smell of blood perfuming the wind, suggesting an impending seizure. A girl got off the last bus to Ansan and tottered toward me with her umbrella held open, pushed along by the wind. I had to get home; I didn&#x2019;t want to crumple to the ground and roll around, contorted like a squid thrown on the grill, in front of a complete stranger. <br><br> I couldn&#x2019;t remember what happened after that. I must have lain down as soon as I walked into my room, without bothering to change. I probably fell asleep snoring. It had been the third seizure I&#x2019;d had in my life, but this was the first time I&#x2019;d sensed another one coming so quickly after the last. And this smell was a different beast altogether: my skin was stinging, my nose was tingling and my mind was foggy. The episode that was about to come felt like it could be the most intense one yet.</p><h2>My Little Pony: Fluttershy and the Fine Furry Friends Fair</h2><p>Fluttershy is shocked to discover that her pet bunny, Angel, wants to enter the annual Fine Furry Friends Fair herding contest!

Penney acoustic, Kris&nbsp;wanted to scream. So she hid in the park when she was supposed&nbsp;to be at Mr. McNutt&#x2019;s, pocketed the $50 fee for the two lessons she&nbsp;skipped, combined it with all her savings, and bought a scratched-to-hell Fender Musicmaster and a busted-out Radio Shack amp&nbsp;from Goldie Pawn for $160. Then she told her mom that McNutt&nbsp;had tried to watch her pee, so now instead of going to lessons Kris&nbsp;huddled in the freezing cold basement, failing to play power chords.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her wrists were bony and weak. The E, B, and G strings&nbsp;sliced her fingertips open. The Musicmaster bruised her ribs where&nbsp;she leaned over it. She wrapped a claw around the guitar&#x2019;s neck&nbsp;and pressed her sore index finger on A, her third finger on D, her&nbsp;fourth finger on G, raked her pick down the strings, and suddenly&nbsp;the same sound came out of her amp that had come out of Tony&nbsp;Iommi&#x2019;s amp. The same chord 100,000 people heard in Philly was&nbsp;right there in the basement with her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She played the chord again. It was the only bright thing in the&nbsp;dingy basement with its single 40-watt bulb and dirty windows. If&nbsp;Kris could play enough of these, in the right order, without stopping,&nbsp;she could block out everything: the dirty snow that never&nbsp;melted, closets full of secondhand clothes, overheated classrooms&nbsp;at Independence High, mind-numbing lectures about the Continental&nbsp;Congress and ladylike behavior and the dangers of running&nbsp;with the wrong crowd and what x equals and how to find for y&nbsp;and what the third person plural for <i>cantar</i> is and what Holden&nbsp;Caulfield&#x2019;s baseball glove symbolizes and what the whale symbolizes&nbsp;and what the green light symbolizes and what everything&nbsp;in the world symbolizes, because apparently nothing is what it&nbsp;seems, and everything is a trick.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was too hard. Counting frets, learning the order of the&nbsp;strings, trying to remember which fingers went on which strings&nbsp;in which order, looking from her notebook to the fretboard to her&nbsp;hand, every chord taking an hour to play. Joan Jett didn&#x2019;t look at&nbsp;her fingers once when she played &#x201c;Do You Wanna Touch Me.&#x201d;&nbsp;Tony Iommi watched his hands, but they were moving so fast they&nbsp;were liquid, nothing like Kris&#x2019;s arthritic start-and-stop. It made&nbsp;her skin itch, it made her face cramp, it made her want to bash her&nbsp;guitar to pieces on the floor.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The basement was refrigerator cold. She could see her breath.&nbsp;Her hands were cramped into claws. Cold radiated up from the&nbsp;concrete floor and turned the blood inside her feet to slush. Her&nbsp;lower back was stuffed with sand.&nbsp;She couldn&#x2019;t do this.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Water gurgled through the pipes as her mom washed dishes&nbsp;upstairs, while her dad&#x2019;s voice sifted down through the floorboards&nbsp;reciting an endless list of complaints. Wild muffled thumps shook&nbsp;dust from the ceiling as her brothers rolled off the couch, punching&nbsp;each other over what to watch on TV. From the kitchen, her dad&nbsp;yelled, <i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me come in there!&#x201d;</i> The house was a big black&nbsp;mountain, pressing down on Kris, forcing her head into the dirt.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kris put her fingers on the second fret, strummed, and while&nbsp;the string was still vibrating, before she could think, Kris slid her&nbsp;hand down to the fifth fret, flicked the strings twice, then instantly&nbsp;slid her hand to the seventh fret and strummed it twice, and she&nbsp;wasn&#x2019;t stopping, her wrist ached but she dragged it down to ten,&nbsp;then twelve, racing to keep up with the riff she heard inside her&nbsp;head, the riff she&#x2019;d listened to on Sabbath&#x2019;s second album over&nbsp;and over again, the riff she played in her head as she walked to&nbsp;McNutt&#x2019;s, as she sat in algebra class, as she lay in bed at night. The&nbsp;riff that said they all underestimated her, they didn&#x2019;t know what&nbsp;she had inside, they didn&#x2019;t know that she could destroy them all.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And suddenly, for one moment, &#x201c;Iron Man&#x201d; was in the basement.&nbsp;She&#x2019;d played it to an audience of no one, but it had sounded&nbsp;exactly the same as it did on the album. The music vibrated in&nbsp;every atom of her being. You could cut her open and look at her&nbsp;through a microscope and Kris Pulaski would be &#x201c;Iron Man&#x201d; all&nbsp;the way down to her DNA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her left wrist throbbed, her fingertips were raw, her back hurt,&nbsp;the tips of her hair were frozen, and her mom never smiled, and&nbsp;once a week her dad searched her room, and her older brother said&nbsp;he was dropping out of college to join the army, and her little brother&nbsp;stole her underwear when she didn&#x2019;t lock her bedroom door, and&nbsp;this was too hard, and everyone was going to laugh at her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she could do this.</p><h2>The Hades Moon: Pluto in Aspect to the Moon</h2><p>Using mythology, archetypal symbolism, and a wealth of case histories, this study provides new material and insight into the many facets of this major, transformative contact between the Moon and Pluto.

But change is easier said than done, especially when it comes to better managing our wellness amidst the chaos of everyday living. Fortunately, wellness coach and award-winning writer Brett Blumenthal has devised a way to inspire and motivate her readers to live healthier and make positive changes in their lives. Although Blumenthal&#x2019;s method is not a quick fix, it is a surprisingly simple one: make one small change per week, for fifty-two weeks, and at the end of a year, you&#x2019;ll be happier and healthier. After all, it is the small changes that are the most realistic, instead of trying to overhaul your lifestyle all at once. <i>52 Small Changes</i> addresses all areas of wellbeing, including nutrition, exercise, stress management, mental wellness, and even the health of one&#x2019;s home environment. By guiding readers through these changes at an easy, manageable pace, Blumenthal provides an engaging roadmap to lasting results and &#x201c;a happier, healthier you.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Brett Blumenthal</strong><br> <strong><br>Question:</strong> Why did you decide to write <em>52 Small Changes: One Year to a Healthier, Happier You</em>?<strong><br><br>Brett Blumenthal:</strong> I wanted to write a book that covers more than just diet and exercise and give readers a more manageable process to creating a healthy lifestyle.<br><strong><br>Q:</strong> What makes <em>52 Small Changes</em> different from other wellness books? <p><strong>BB:</strong> <em>52 Small Changes</em> provides a holistic approach to wellness, and shows that by making small changes over a period of time you can achieve big results. By incorporating small changes every week you give yourself a better chance of sticking to these changes, and <em>52 Small Changes</em> gives you the tools and tips to make that happen.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you have a favorite chapter or section of <em>52 Small Changes</em>?</p> <p><strong>BB:</strong> My favorite sections focus on components of life that we take for granted e.g. Laugh Out Loud (chapter 16), and Live with Purpose (chapter 20). I also like the unexpected chapters that evolved as I was writing the book such as Find Your Own Spirituality (chapter 52).</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are the chapters of the book written in a specific order, or can you make each change in any order?</p> <p><strong>BB:</strong> The chapters are organized so that you don&#x2019;t have to tackle one area of wellbeing, such as nutrition, all at once. Also, those changes that seem easier to most are at the beginning of the book, like drinking more water. My advice is to take the approach that works best for you and challenge yourself using the extra credit sections in selected chapters.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> 52 small changes seem like a lot! Do you have suggestions in the book for people who might lose motivation to help them get back on course?</p> <p><strong>BB:</strong> A great way to stay focused is by journaling--both food and exercise journaling. The book also provides a number of additional resources, such as an assessment tool that can be taken monthly or every few months, and checklists that you can use throughout your journey. By taking the time to make the 52 small changes, you have the ability to gain years of your life back. We all fall off the wagon at times, but if you think about why and be forgiving, you&#x2019;ll have a better chance of succeeding the next time you try to make a change.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Who is this book written for?</p> <p><strong>BB:</strong> This book is relevant to both men and woman of all ages. It&#x2019;s also great for kids as you can make many of these changes at any age and still see results. This book would make a great family tool, or even a tool for friends--you can use the book and the changes to keep each other accountable.</p>Brett Blumenthal is founder and CEO of Be Healthy, Inc., a wellness promotion company whose mission is to create a healthier America, one city at a time, by holding unique events that educate, inspire, and empower members of local communities to live and maintain healthy lifestyles.

He delves instead into why Italian Americans have such a complicated relationship with the "old country," and how Italy produces some of the world's most astonishing art while suffering from corruption, political fragmentation, and an enfeebled civil society.<br> With topics ranging from the pervasive force of Dante's poetry to the meteoric rise of Silvio Berlusconi, Luzzi presents the Italians in all their glory and squalor, relating the problems that plague Italy today to the country's ancient roots. He shares how his "two Italies"&#x2015;the earthy southern Italian world of his immigrant childhood and the refined northern Italian realm of his professional life&#x2015;join and clash in unexpected ways that continue to enchant the many millions who are either connected to Italy by ancestry or bound to it by love.</p></p><p><b>Joseph Luzzi</b> is the author of <i>Romantic Europe and the Ghost of Italy</i>, which won the Scaglione Prize for Italian Studies from the Modern Language Association. His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, and <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>. He has received an essay award from the Dante Society of America, a teaching prize from Yale College, and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The first American-born child in his Italian family, he earned his doctorate from Yale University and is a professor at Bard College.<i>Introduction: The Witch of Naples</i> <p></p>"You killed him! You killed him!" <p></p> <i>"Gius�, aspetta," </i>my mother called as I fled the kitchen in tears, accusing her and my father of murder on the holiest Catholic day of the year. Easter Sunday had started with such promise. That morning, the house had been filled with the smell of frittata, a sausage, egg, and cheese casserole that left rose-colored oil slicks on your plate. I mopped them up with <i>u panu di Pasqua</i>, the Calabrian Easter bread made from two hard-boiled eggs baked into a figure-eight-shaped dough that was flavored with anise. <p></p>As the flavors were blending, I had awaited the arrival of my favorite relative, Cumara Amandina. The mere mention of my godmother&#x2019;s name could halt card games between my father and his expat circle. She had earned the most glorious title any Calabrian woman could hope for: <i>fimminella, </i>"little woman." She who cooks, cleans, bears children, nurses grudges, would sooner self-flagellate than commit adultery, and doesn&#x2019;t put on <i>too much </i>weight with the passing of years. (As opposed to the non- <i>fimminelle</i>, huge women who roamed Little Italy like mastodons in black dresses.) <p></p>The gift of beauty didn&#x2019;t end with Amandina. She had three girls, and the youngest, Giuliana, had earned that other honor reserved for the Calabrian female elite: she looked German. My people revered those few fair-haired creatures with blue eyes and light skin, women with none of the facial hair that afflicted so many of my darker relations. I was one of these black-haired and brown-eyed creatures myself, but I too had something that set me apart&#x2014;something suspiciously <i>&#x2019;merican </i>that seeped out of my adventure books and striped rugby shirts. Giuliana and I seemed destined for each other from childhood. Had we met ten years earlier and thousands of miles away in a southern Italian village, we would have been the occasion for an exchange of livestock and toasts to healthy male children. As it was, she and I just stammered around each other, too paralyzed by old-world expectations to have anything close to a normal conversation. <p></p>Amandina arrived, and with a living, breathing present: my very own Easter rabbit. All during childhood I burned with envy as I watched other children care for their pet cats, hamsters, even parrots and lizards. Though our yard teemed with winged and hoofed animals of all kinds, our home was off-limits to the nonhuman. <i>"I case sunu per gente e i animale</i> <i>per mangiare" </i>("Houses are for people and animals are for eating"), my parents would say. Anything with four legs was banished from the house. Especially dogs, the animals I yearned for more than any other. I often saw my parents carrying a decapitated chicken or a bucket filled with crows shot from a downstairs window&#x2014;Pasquale and Yolanda Luzzi were hardly the ideal stewards for man&#x2019;s best friend. The one dog we had, Sam, was kept in an escape-proof dog house sealed with wire mesh. Sam was no fool: he ran away a few months after arriving. Maybe he saw my father whaling away on our poor goat, as was his habit, and realized he would be much better off with a real American family. <p></p>I took the rabbit in my arms. Circumstances had kept me from becoming an "animal person," but this guy, with his white fur and gentle eyes&#x2014;a present from my favorite relative to boot&#x2014;was different, just like Cumara Amandina, who was much more delicate than the bruiser Calabrian matrons who poured into our home on Sundays. I would cherish him, I swore to myself. I&#x2019;d make sure that the creature enjoyed a different fate from Sam&#x2019;s. My mother and father smiled, Amandina gushed, and the bunny went back in his box. <p></p>That afternoon I imagined that the rabbit was resting while I played outside. In truth, he was about to face an ordeal that would have shocked even battle-scarred Sam. Apparently my mother and father weren&#x2019;t just admiring the rabbit&#x2019;s dreamy eyes; they were sizing up his haunches. I don&#x2019;t know what it took&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s usual two brisk whacks with a stick to the back of the skull or my father&#x2019;s preferred twist of the neck in his thick fingers&#x2014; but by five p.m. my pet had become an entr�e. I came into the kitchen to find him splayed out, his glycerine blue eyes lifeless and coated in oil, over a bed of roasted potatoes. <p></p>It took my mom an hour to calm me as she explained that she and my father hadn&#x2019;t tricked me. They had planned it all along and just assumed that I knew what was coming. She spoke with a smile. That was the worst of it: to her, destroying my pet was no different from weeding the garden. <p></p>I followed my mother to the kitchen table, slunk back into my abandoned seat, and, tears spilling onto my napkin, ate my pet rabbit. <p></p>* * * <p></p>When I went to sleep that night with a belly full of my godmother&#x2019;s gift, I knew I had done something not necessarily wrong, but certainly strange: eating a pet bunny may have been acceptable in Acri, the Calabrian hill town where my family had lived before emigrating, but not in the suburban Rhode Island town where I grew up. I had to admit, the rabbit was delicious. But what if my friends found out? It wasn&#x2019;t just the slaughter that troubled me. It was the feeling that everything I was learning in school, seeing on television, and picking up from my friends was pulling me away from my family&#x2019;s world. <p></p>Around this time I was named to the Little League all-star team, a group of local boys who represented our town in a nationwide baseball tournament. After our third straight win, I came home bursting with joy: my cousin had pitched a no-hitter to advance us deep into the state play-offs. My eyes adjusted to the change in light as I entered my father&#x2019;s lair: the refurbished basement where he held court, seated at the head of the dinner table in near darkness to reduce the electricity bill. <p></p> <i>"Pap�, abbiamo vinto, abbiamo vinto!" </i>("We won, we won!") I exclaimed. <p></p>He fixed me with a shark&#x2019;s stare and spoke in Calabrian. <p></p>"I heard you made a fool out of yourself. And the whole town was watching." <p></p>I buried my face in my glove and ran from the room. It was not enough that I had been chosen for the team, nor that we had won. I batted .556 and fielded a flawless third base during that play-off run. But for my father all that mattered was that one fateful at bat, when I waved at a pitch nearly over my head, my hands squeezing the bat so hard that they creased the grip. A home run in front of the town&#x2019;s faithful would have brought me the approval that was missing in our split-level on Batterson Avenue. He was right: I had strode into the path of the stitched leather ball, swung from the heels, and&#x2014;like all those who daydream in front of fastballs&#x2014;struck out. <p></p>I didn&#x2019;t realize this at the time, but my father was swinging at wild pitches of his own&#x2014;and gripping the bat just as tightly as I was&#x2014;as he struggled to hang on to his diminished Calabrian world. <p></p>* * * <p></p>On November 21, 1956, eleven years before I was born, Pasquale Luzzi and his four children cleared customs at JFK and joined his wife, Yolanda, in the United States. They were emigrating from the poor region of Calabria in southern Italy. <p></p>My maternal grandfather, Carmine Crocco, had worked in the United States from 1909 to 1923 as an itinerant gravedigger, mostly in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, before moving back to his Italian village. He had won citizenship because of his U.S. military service in World War I, so my mother earned the right to bring her family to the United States, where&#x2014;thanks to my father&#x2019;s lifetime of factory work&#x2014;we joined the middle class. <p></p>By the time I feasted on my Easter rabbit, we owned our own home, a squat three-bedroom that somehow slept eight. In true Italian American style, we lived mostly downstairs, a cavern coated with cooking grease&#x2014;and the seat of my father&#x2019;s royal authority&#x2014;while the upstairs furniture was kept protected from the human stain. Eventually I would attend an expensive private university (thanks to scholarships and financial aid) and wind up on a career path smoother than any child of Calabria could ever have hoped for. But first I had to escape the Italian south. <p></p>My parents described their region as a land with a blistering sun and an arid terrain, a ferocious &#x2019;Ndrangheta (the local Mafia), and an untranslatable worldview called <i>la miseria</i>, "the misery"&#x2014;a pervasive belief born of poverty that things will go worse than you expect them to and that fate is not your friend. For my parents, <i>la miseria </i>meant stillborn babies, barefoot children, and no meat on the Sunday table. In their world, only the leather-tough and the single-minded (the <i>teste</i> <i>dure</i>, "hard heads")&#x2014;blunt, tanklike men like my father and his four brothers&#x2014; endured. Even today, when Calabrian immigrants speak of the future, they will often add the subjunctive disclaimer <i>"Si Dio vo&#x2019; " </i>("Should God will it"). The Calabrian God was one to fear, not to love, and the region he lorded over was no place for Grand Tourists seeking intimate encounters with Botticelli in the Uffizi. It was the quarry for men like the robust Norman Douglas and his <i>Old Calabria </i>(1915), a pioneering work in extreme travel writing: <p></p> <p></p>"This corner of Magna Graecia is a severely parsimonious manifestation of nature. Rocks and waters! But these rocks and waters are actualities; the stuff whereof man is made. A landscape so luminous, so resolutely scornful of accessories, hints at brave and simple forms of expression; it brings us to the ground, where we belong; it medicines to the disease of introspection and stimulates a capacity which we are in danger of unlearning amid our morbid hyperborean gloom&#x2014;the capacity for honest contempt: contempt of that scarecrow of a theory which would have us neglect what is earthly, tangible." <p></p> <p></p>This raw genealogy at once repelled and seduced me. I longed to cure the disease of introspection&#x2014;maybe Calabria would make a man of me. So in the 1990s, while many of my friends pursued lucrative careers on the new dot.com frontier, I entered graduate school to study Italian literature: a gut decision in a life marked, then and since, by hedged bets. I hadn&#x2019;t pursued the subject as an undergraduate; a vague attraction to Dante&#x2019;s poetry was my only link to the field. And let&#x2019;s just say my college transcript didn&#x2019;t inspire visions of an endowed chair at a leafy New England university. When I asked one of my professors for a letter of recommendation, he told me I was a likable-enough kid, but really . . . <p></p>But even in those first fitful steps toward Italy, I felt pulled by something more instinctual than academic clout or a career calling. I wanted access to my family&#x2019;s history. Yes, they had abandoned Italy for good, but a part of them remained fixed in that blasted Calabrian landscape. Their broken English, canned tomatoes and slaughtered pigs, home-made wine and cured meats&#x2014;it all reeked of the Old Country. Especially the tripe. Some days I would come home from school and burst into the house for an afternoon snack, hoping for a buttered slab of my mom&#x2019;s freshly baked bread, only to have my hunger stifled by the odor wafting up from a downstairs pot. These were the days my mother boiled cow stomach, the blanched organ that revealed just how different&#x2014;less refined, less American&#x2014;we were from our neighbors, with their vacuumed Pontiac Bonnevilles and pine-scented air fresheners. <p></p>A career in the language and culture of my family would immerse me in the mystery of their lost Italian world, which sometimes felt like a birthright, more often a pipe dream. Around 1304, Dante compared the nonexistent Italian language&#x2014;at the time, Italy comprised various city-states and their local dialects&#x2014;to a scent that filled the air but whose source could never be found. Italian culture was like that to me. I sensed it all around&#x2014;in the mildewed winepress and hanging prosciutto shanks of our cellar, in the oily redness of my mother&#x2019;s sauces and the leathery texture of her cured goat cheese&#x2014;but it was somehow remote from the "real" Italy, with its Renaissance palaces, handmade leather goods, and covered jewelry stalls on the Ponte Vecchio. My Ph.D. in Italian would be the passport to a cultural homeland that class, history, and society had all conspired to deny me and my family. <p></p>When I finally made it to Italy for the first time, as a college student in 1987, it was Florence and not Calabria that beckoned. I yearned for the Italy of Dante and Michelangelo, not the one of sharp cheese and salted anchovies. As soon as I arrived, I felt the weight of the past in the crooked cobblestone streets and the sidewalks that barely held off the Vespas straddled by women in chestnut lipstick and leather miniskirts. Each day, I left my apartment near the bombastic arch of Piazza della Libert� to walk down Via Cavour, the nineteenth-century boulevard that connects the city&#x2019;s modern and medieval neighborhoods. My route to school skirted the market of San Lorenzo, where stalls of fruit, bread, meat, clothing, and wine have been lining up like dominoes since the late 1800s. From there it was a short stroll east to the Duomo, begun in 1298 by Arnolfo da Cambio and completed by Filippo Brunelleschi in 1436. From this cobblestone womb of the city I would head west along the Corso and into the Piazza della Repubblica, the original site of the city, where the Romans&#x2014;according to legend, Julius Caesar himself&#x2014;established a military camp in the first century B.C. Once I had my espresso from the ornate Caff� Gilli, founded in 1733, I circled back east, south of the Duomo and into Santa Croce, the site of the basilica that houses the remains of the nation&#x2019;s founding fathers. There I would stand before the statue of Dante, nineteen feet high and keeping angry vigil over the stones of Santa Croce. <p></p>As seduced as I was by Florence, I still longed to understand the Italy of my parents. So on a cold and rainy November day of my first semester abroad, I boarded the train for Calabria. I felt like I was in Europe until we reached Naples. Then the journey slogged from one local stop to the next on antiquated lines and obsolete regional trains packed with southern Italian families laden with salami. When I finally arrived hours later in Cosenza, my parents&#x2019; home province, I felt that I had lurched a century backward into a struggling nation, far from the smiling angels of Fra Angelico and the muscular women of Michelangelo. My blood is 100 percent Calabrian; I looked a lot like the young men milling about the station and piazzas. But the good people of Cosenza regarded me as if I had alighted from a spaceship. Like twins shipped off to different homes at birth, our bodies declared a common biology, but our bearing, gestures, and clothes suggested otherwise. This was my first journey south, but I would discover the Italy of my parents only much later. <p></p>* * * <p></p>"Sleep . . . is what Sicilians want, and they will always hate anyone who tries to wake them." <p></p>In 2003, as my Intercity train from Florence pulled into Napoli Centrale, I recalled these words from <i>The Leopard</i>, Lampedusa&#x2019;s great novel about the fall of the Italian aristocracy on the eve of national unification in 1861. We southern Italians, remarks Prince Salina, alias the Leopard, wish for nothing more than a "voluptuous immobility," free from the demands of history and innocent of the crimes committed in the name of progress. <p></p>Naples, the seat of the Bourbon dynasty that ruled the Leopard&#x2019;s...</p><h2>God&#39;s Generals: The Missionaries (Volume 5)</h2><p><b>They Served God to the Ends of the Earth</b>In his fifth <i>God&#x2019;s Generals</i> volume, Roberts Liardon chronicles some of the great evangelists who risked their lives to take the gospel message to strange and unknown cultures around the world, including... <ul><li><b><i>Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf</i></b>&#x2014;the Austrian nobleman whose passion for Christ ushered in the Moravian revival of the 1700s.</li><li><i><b>David Brainerd</b></i>&#x2014;the young American colonist who sacrificially reached out to Native Americans.</li><li><i><b>William Carey</b></i>&#x2014;the British shoemaker and Bible translator whose passion to reach India birthed a missionary revolution.</li><li><i><b>David Livingstone</b></i>&#x2014;the explorer who crossed the &#x201c;unknown continent&#x201d; and opened the heart of Africa to the gospel.</li><li><i><b>Adoniram Judson</b></i>&#x2014;the &#x201c;Father of American Missions,&#x201d; who endured tragedy to reach the people of Burma.</li><li><i><b>Hudson Taylor</b></i>&#x2014;the first missionary to use the phrase &#x201c;Great Commission,&#x201d; who pioneered the China Inland Mission, transforming millions of lives along the way.</li><li><i><b>Hiram Bingham</b></i>&#x2014;the first Protestant missionary, who spent twenty years serving Christ in what is now Hawaii.</li><li><i><b>Amy Carmichael</b></i>&#x2014;the selfless Irish missionary who dedicated her life to the forsaken children of India.</li><li><i><b>Jonathan Goforth</b></i>&#x2014;the passionate Canadian revivalist who brought salvation and healing to hundreds of thousands of Chinese people.</li></ul>The sacrifice and courage of these spiritual pioneers are sure to stoke the fires of your faith and revive within your heart a spirit of evangelism and compassion for the lost.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Roberts Liardon is a leading Protestant church historian.

I consider them to be required reading for our people. This volume on The Missionaries will no doubt inspire a wave of new sold-out lovers of God to invade the nations of the world, ready to pay any price to spread this wonderful<br> gospel of the kingdom. <i>God's Generals</i> carries such profound importance because it provides us with perspective, it creates an awareness of a God-inspired momentum, and it ignites a hunger for what might be possible again in our lifetimes. Author Roberts Liardon does an amazing job of recalibrating our need for true heroes, while, at the same time, addressing weaknesses, shortcomings, and even failures of these great missionary leaders. He does this all without slander or even downgrading the importance of their roles in history. I love this transparent approach, and I highly recommend this volume for all who consider themselves disciples of Jesus Christ.<br><b>--Bill Johnson, Bethel Church, Redding, California, Author, When Heaven Invades Earth and Hosting the Presence</b><br><br>As one of the modern-day historians in the body of Christ, Roberts Liardon has brought forth another great jewel in his <i>God's Generals</i> series. Some of my mentors over the years have been books. The lives portrayed in this classic book on pioneering missionaries will surely join my "Hall of Heroes." The shadow of these humble and sacrificial lives in Christ is being cast once again upon the lives of many people because of this amazing author.

These biographies awakened many memories of the joys and hardships Rolland and I have experienced as missionaries. As a skilled storyteller, Roberts weaves factual accounts with everyday struggles, heartaches, and victories. Our great pioneers of faith had two common threads: lives bathed in much prayer, and guidance by the Holy Spirit. <i>God's Generals</i> will show you how to lay down your life and consider everything a loss compared to knowing Jesus.

The "Rival," for example, is envious to the point of malice. The "Blood-sucker" expects you to be there every moment. The "Controller" must be in charge of everything, from where you meet for lunch to whom you date. Yager lays out strategies for dealing with the problems when you want to keep the friendship, while also warning about extreme behavior and discussing triggers that lead to friendship conflicts, such as jealousy, anger, and change (of marital status or job, for example). Yager also guides you to examine your own destructive or harmful traits and recognize patterns in your family background that affect your friendships. </p><p> Overall, this book will help you learn how to deal with destructive friendships--when and how to save them, when and how to end them, and how to cope when a business friendship goes wrong. Yager, who has appeared on <i>Oprah</i> and other TV programs, also encourages you to celebrate the joys of positive friendships. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Jan Yager, Ph.D.,</b> is a sociologist and the author of <i>Friendshifts�: The Power of Friendship and How It Shapes Our Lives.</i> Recognized as the number one expert on friendship in the country, she has been seen and heard on <i>Oprah, The View, The O'Reilly Factor,</i> and NPR, as well as on numerous other national television and radio programs.

Additionally, this work offers a much needed voice to the current dialogue of the larger society and especially the discussion of the topic in the church world.

When he vanished without a trace in November 1934, Ruess left behind thousands of pages of journals, letters, and poems, as well as more than a hundred watercolor paintings and blockprint engravings. <br><br>Everett Ruess is hailed as a paragon of solo exploration, while the mystery of his death remains one of the greatest riddles in the annals of American adventure. David Roberts began probing the life and death of Everett Ruess for <i>National Geographic Adventure</i> magazine in 1998.&nbsp;<i>Finding Everett Ruess</i> is the result of his personal journeys into the remote areas explored by Ruess, his interviews with oldtimers who encountered the young vagabond and with Ruess&#x2019;s closest living relatives, and his deep immersion in Ruess&#x2019;s writings and artwork. More than 75 years after his vanishing, Ruess stirs the kinds of passion and speculation accorded such legendary doomed American adventurers as <i>Into the Wild&#x2019;s </i>Chris McCandless and Amelia Earhart.</p><p>DAVID ROBERTS is the author of more than 20 books on mountaineering, adventure, and history, including <i>No Shortcuts to the Top, K2</i>, and <i>The Will to Climb, </i>which he co-wrote with Ed Viesturs and a memoir <i>On&nbsp;The Ridge Between Life and Death</i>. He has written for <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>National Geographic Adventure</i>, and <i>Smithsonian</i>.

And for many of us homesickness is a nagging place of grief. This book connects that desire and disappointment with the story of the Bible, helping us to see that there is a homemaking God with wide arms of welcome&#x2015;and a church commissioned with this same work. "Many of us seem to be recovering the sacred, if ordinary, beauty of place," writes author Jen Pollock Michel. "Perhaps we're reading along with Wendell Berry, falling in love with Berry's small-town barber and Jayber Crow's small-town life. . . . Or maybe we're simply reading our Bibles better, discovering that while we might wish to flatten Scripture to serve our didactic purposes, it rises up in flesh and sinew, muscle and bone: God's holy story is written in the lives of people and their places." Including a five-session discussion guide and paired with a companion DVD, <em>Keeping Place</em> offers hope to the wanderer, help to the stranded, and a new vision of what it means to live today with our longings for our eternal home.</p><p>Jen Pollock Michel is the author of <em>Teach Us to Want</em> and a regular contributor to <em>Christianity Today</em> and Moody Bible Institute's <em>Today in the Word</em>. A wife and mother of five, Jen lives in Toronto, Canada, and is an enthusiastic supporter of HOPE International and Safe Families."<em>Keeping Place</em> is a lovely reflection on home&#x2015;from our spiritual longing to the nitty gritty of keeping a house. As Jen takes us through reflections on her life and other people's stories, through literature and Scripture, I was grateful to delve deeper into the role of place in many aspects of our lives. In a transient time, this book is a welcome invitation to consider how we do life with each other and with God." (Kent Annan, author of Slow Kingdom Coming and Following Jesus Through the Eye of the Needle)<br><br>"Jen Pollock Michel takes us through the Scriptures as she explores the stories of God's people displaced, wandering, and longing for home. She captures the tension in all of our hearts: we are longing for something more, something permanent, and something better. We are longing for home&#x2015;a place. Jen gently encourages us, reminding us that though we are longing, God has given us a home to tend to, people to love and care for, and a table for feasting and sharing. Ultimately, she points us to the only one who can fulfill our every longing&#x2015;Jesus. Our home is in and with Christ, and one day we will be with him forevermore. Until then, Jen helps us learn to keep place." (Trillia Newbell, author of Enjoy and Fear and Faith)<br><br>"With her signature depth and grace, Jen Pollock Michel casts a vision of home as both a human desire and a heavenly promise. She calls us to build imperfect dwellings alongside our loved ones in this life precisely because we are destined for a perfect dwelling in the life to come. Women and men alike will find joy in her vision of keeping house. This is a book that invites you in and lets you stay awhile, and I'm grateful for it." (Katelyn Beaty, former managing editor, Christianity Today)<br><br>"It is one thing to write truth, and another to write it beautifully. With the skilled and hypnotic prose I have come to eagerly expect of her, Jen Michel invites us to consider the sacred space of home and the sacred duty of its keeping. We are seekers of home by design, and our homesickness is no accident. Exploring the rhythms of plenty and loss, worship and work, routine and rest, Michel exhorts us, male and female, to be faithful homemakers until such time as we inhabit our true and final dwelling place. In a time when transience and individuality mark the lives of many, she offers here a worthy meditation for the people of God." (Jen Wilkin, author of None Like Him)<br><br>"Jen Pollock Michel has a unique gift of making theology come alive. She weaves a rich knowledge of Scripture with her own compelling story, offering us a fresh perspective of a God who is the maker and keeper of place, the creator who cultivates the space where we find ourselves and the eternal home we long for. Her perspective is original, fresh, and unexpected." (Micha Boyett, author of Found)<br><br>"What an amazing book this is! Jen Pollock Michel takes us on a journey through Scripture, church history, and the many places she has called home as she paints a picture of God as the ultimate Homemaker. <em>Keeping Place</em> stirs and prods us to consider our contributions to establishing a sense of home in today's world, even as we ache with homesickness for the New Jerusalem God has promised." (Trevin Wax, managing editor, The Gospel Project, author of Counterfeit Gospels)<br><br>"Rife with scriptural acuity and sumptuous prose, <em>Keeping Place</em> has become my favorite read of the year. Michel's command of both tradition and the hunger of our age is at once refreshing and comforting. She invites us to embrace the shadow of something more that lingers at the edge of hearts, elucidating how the journey homeward happens only together with those here now and those gone before. <em>Keeping Place</em> rivals and bests most contemporary meditations on desiring the kingdom, and Michel has continued in this second book a trajectory of some of the finest scriptural grounding and pastoral care in print today." (Preston Yancey, author of Out of the House of Bread)<br><br>"Michel (<em>Teach Us to Want</em>), contributor for <em>Christianity Today</em> and <em>Today in the Word</em>, mixes theology and real-life scenarios to create a homey place of reflection. . . . Readers will appreciate Michel's section on doing work at home, which explores the ins and outs of daily life and how every bit of work helps to create a welcoming, comforting environment. Her examples are all engrossing and rich with parallels between biblical characters and today's hectic lifestyles." (Publishers Weekly, March 13, 2017)<br><br>"<em>Keeping Place</em> weaves together a wide range of materials and supports, drawing from history, cultural studies, literature, and the Bible. It discusses crossing borders, immigration, and mobility, and considers each topic through the author's personal vignettes and published reports of other individuals' stories. All this theory wraps up in the book's second half, which includes a dash of do-it-yourself to help turn its big ideas into reality. While theory often sounds better that its iterations in lived reality, <em>Keeping Place</em> is cognizant of offering practices and ideas for truly building a better home. It considers the importance of neighbors, church, love, and marriage, among other aspects. There is a place for this book in the heart of a world so divided along national and international lines. <em>Keeping Place</em> stands ready to offer alternative sites within a world that often feels divided&#x2015;places where home really matters, with the idea that everyone is welcome to find their own place." (Jeremiah Rood, Foreword Reviews, May/June 2017)<br><br>"This well-researched title offers profound insights and makes connections most laypeople wouldn't. The author's extensive knowledge of Scripture is evident, and she strikes a readable balance of personal and historical anecdotes, biblical references, and thoughtful reflection."

What follows is a coming-of-age story that is both heartbreaking and exhilarating.

By the time she is twenty-five years old they are both gone and Claire is very much alone in the world.<br><br> Claire's story is less of a tragic tale and more of a remarkable lesson on how to overcome some of life's greatest hardships.

In this searing, devastating, and ultimately cathartic memoir, Smith uses Elisabeth K�bler-Ross&#x2019; well-known five stages of grief as a narrative framework, beginning with denial, followed by anger, bargaining, depression, and ending with acceptance, as she moves back and forth chronologically in time. It is brutally honest as she becomes overwhelmed by grief and by the state of being &#x201c;parentless.&#x201d; She falls into a depressive funk. A car accident reminds her that she has no one to call when something like this happens. She drinks too much. She finds little reason to exist. Hearing Dave Eggers read from his best-selling memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (2000), another memoir of loss, is a turning point in her recovery, as she becomes a volunteer coordinator at the Los Angeles branch of Eggers&#x2019; 826 Valencia Project, a nonprofit organization that helps children and adults develop writing skills. Today, Smith is a bereavement counselor. By facilitating grief groups, running workshops, and conducting one-on-one counseling sessions, she has come around, as she puts it, to the other side of grief. A powerful, moving memoir of overcoming grief and loss. --June Sawyers</p><h2>Anthropology (Quick Study Academic)</h2><p><p>Defines the most important aspects of various forms of anthropology, including archeology, cultural and biological anthropology. <br><br>For students studying anthropology; most helpful for those in introductory anthropology. <br><br></p> <p></p></p><p></p><h2>Flawless (Pretty Little Liars, Book 2)</h2><p><p> Spencer stole her sister's boyfriend.

I began my career in real estate in the 1960s. It was wonderful then and has evolved into something even more wonderful today. What a joy it is for people to own real property�to have a place they can truly call home. And you get to delight in helping people achieve their dreams of home ownership, while earning a good income for yourself and your loved ones. It�s a truly satisfying career choice.<p> Back in the 60s, real estate was primarily an older man�s business. There were few young men choosing real estate as a career and even fewer women. </p><p> Fortunately for all of us, times have changed. I know of some young people these days who got their real estate licenses while still in high school and had a jump start on their careers on graduation day! Due to its flexibility of working hours, the field has provided excellent opportunities for thousands. I�ve seen many exciting changes over the years and congratulate you on your choice of a career in real estate. </p><p> When I wrote the first version of this material, it was actually two separate books. One just covered the listing aspect of real estate. The other, selling. They were first printed in the 1980s� back before computers, wireless phones, pagers, and the Internet. You are so fortunate today. Much of the research you need to do is available with the click of a few keys�and in minutes. I used to invest hours in researching data for Comparable Market Analyses, and reading through the Multiple Listing Service book (yes, it was a book, back then). </p><p> While the times have changed, some important aspects of buying and selling real estate have not. These include: the reasons people need your services; motivations for wanting a particular type of home; how husbands and wives relate to each other during real estate transactions; and how you must relate to them. That�s the power of this book. In it are step-by-step strategies for getting started in this business, for finding people who need your services, for helping them like and trust you and your expertise in the field, how to prepare for a listing presentation, what to expect from potential buyers, what to say when they give you the most common questions or objections, how to negotiate offers and counteroffers, and how to close people on either listing their property with you or buying the home you�ve helped them find that best suits their needs. </p><p> In this revised edition, I have kept the best of the original books, deleted old strategies that may not be as effective today as they once were, and have added strategies that work phenomenally well in today�s marketplace. I cover the use of technology to save you time and increase your appearance of competence with clients. This book is designed to help you achieve a certain level of comfort within the real estate industry�being comfortable with the knowledge of what to expect and how to succeed in this truly wonderful career. Treat it as a textbook. Read it with a highlighter, a pen, and a notebook. Let it become your quick reference guide and your study guide as you grow. There is enough material here to help you through many years in this business. And, to help you find the success you dream of more quickly than you would without it. My wish for you is to find as much joy and satisfaction from your real estate career as I did mine. <br><br> MASTERING THE ART OF SELLING REAL ESTATE <br><br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br><br> Portrait of a Professional <br> Real Estate Salesperson<br> If you are reading this book, you may already have had a day that stands out as your worst day in real estate. If you�re new to the business and haven�t had such a day, don�t worry, you will. Just don�t let it deter you. Perseverance has made all the difference in my life. </p><p> My worst day is one I will always remember. I was new to real estate, nineteen years old, and I didn�t own a suit. So, I wore my black and silver high school band uniform to work. My car was a beat-up, old convertible with holes in the roof and springs popping through the back seat. Needless to say, I didn�t present the most professional image. </p><p> Like most new licensees, I didn�t know what to do with myself. The training program in my office consisted of the sales manager giving me the thumbs up signal and telling me to �hang in there.� I was warm and friendly with all my prospects, but didn�t know how to close a sale. In fact, I was so nice that sometimes when people didn�t buy from me, they would send apologetic notes to my broker, saying how nice I was. </p><p> Until I discovered that there was such a thing as sales training, my earnings averaged $42 per month. That was for my first six months! It doesn�t matter how you budgeted, even in the early 1960s, $42 a month didn�t make it. </p><p> My enthusiasm was beginning to fade. In fact, there was a low period during which I decided real estate wasn�t for me. Three sales had fallen out in one week. One day I walked into my broker�s office and said, �I�m thinking about quitting.� He had no answer for me�the thumbs up signal wasn�t good enough anymore. </p><p> I was so depressed that I went back to my desk and started looking at the classifieds. Then the telephone rang. To my surprise, through the receiver came, without a doubt, the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. It was an absolute melody. She said something that I had never heard before. �Sir, my husband and I would like to buy a home.� I thought someone was playing a joke on me. Then, she said, �Sir, we�d like to spend around $200,000.� This really shook me up because the area I worked in was Simi Valley, California, and then the average home sold for between $18,000 and $20,000. </p><p> I felt like saying, �Ma�am, would you like half of the valley, a quarter of the valley, or what?� I didn�t though. Somehow I kept my composure and set an appointment for 2:00 p.m. that day. To say I was nervous after this phone call would be a terrible understatement. I didn�t even know of a home that was worth that much in Simi Valley. After driving around for a few hours, I finally found the right home on the top of a hill. It was absolutely perfect! It had a phenomenal view. It was a $187,000 mansion. My career finally looked like it was turning around. </p><p> On the way back to the office, they announced on the radio that it was the hottest day of the year�105 degrees, 75 percent humidity. I didn�t care, though. My enthusiasm was zooming off the charts! Back in the office, I pulled out a piece of paper, like any starving real estate person, and figured out what 6 percent of $187,000 was. People around me could hear me say, �All right! I�m going to make some big money here!� </p><p> Right at 2:00 p.m., in walked this gorgeous creature. She had on a $300 outfit and diamonds everywhere. Her hair was beautifully styled, her makeup exquisite. It must have taken at least two hours to put it on. I jumped up to meet her. </p><p> Being such a nervous wreck, I don�t even remember how I got her into my car. As we drove down the street, I couldn�t think of a thing to say to her. I was embarrassed by my car and nervous about the possibility of selling such a high-priced property. </p><p> All of a sudden, my car started to jerk. In my excitement about finding the right home, I had forgotten to check my gas tank. It was empty! Rolling the car to a stop at the side of the road, I turned to my potential new client and said, �Ma�am, I�ve never had anything like this happen before. Please forgive me. There�s a gas station only half a mile away. I�ll be right back.� </p><p> There I was in my newly dry-cleaned, wool band uniform jogging down the street with my gas can. I wish you could have been there when I got back to that car. Not only was I a sweaty wreck, the woman had sat in that closed car at 105 degrees the whole time I was gone. Everything that had been on her face was now on her chest. Her hair even looked like it was melting. �Ma�am, I�m so sorry,� I said. �I�ve never had this happen. You can have all the air.� I turned all the vents on her and drove on to the house. </p><p> By the time we got to the house, I had decided nothing could be worse than selling real estate as a career. Trying to regain my composure, I thought I�d show her the beautiful view from the patio. She would have to be impressed with it and might forget what had happened with the car. </p><p> Walking over to the sliding door, I said, �Ma�am, I think you�ll enjoy this view.� I held the curtain back for her to see it. Well, she thought the sliding glass door was open and walked right into it. She hit her head hard and was obviously stunned. She looked at me for a split second with an expression I cannot describe and ran to lock herself in the bathroom. </p><p> Luckily, the sellers were gone. But now I had to get her out of the bathroom. I began knocking on the door, pleading with her to come out. Upon hearing a noise behind me, I turned to see that the sellers had returned ahead of schedule. Needless to say, they wanted to know what was going on. With the help of the sellers, the lady came out of the bathroom, and I got her back to my car. Not a word was spoken on the trip back to the office. When we got there, like a zombie, she got out of my car, walked to hers, and drove away. </p><p> I went into the office and took some aspirin. This was definitely the end of my real estate career. Nothing could be worse than what I�d just gone through. Out came the classifieds again. Then, there was a phone call for me. When I answered, the man on the other end said, �Yes, Mr. Hopkins, you just showed my wife a home. I just can�t believe what she�s told me. I want to see it, too.� I felt like fainting dead on the spot! </p><p> They were both coming to the office right then. This time I had a goal for when they arrived. My goal was to get them from the front door to my desk without incident. </p><p> Now, there are certain types of people that we instantly like�people we can build a rapport with very quickly. This lady�s husband was one of those types for me. After a few minutes, he and I were talking easily and getting along really well. All the while, his wife watched us both very carefully. </p><p> All of a sudden, this horsefly flew by. We had each shooed it away a couple of times during our conversation. This time, though, as a joke, I reached out for the fly, acted like I had it, and popped it in my mouth. Much to my surprise, I really did have it! It was moving around in there. </p><p> Now, I could do one of two things. I could swallow it and say something like, �Mmm, we love them here!� Or, I could spit it out. I chose the latter. When I looked up, that couple had this amazed look on their faces. The wife was nudging the husband with her elbow and saying, �I told you so.� </p><p> Needless to say, I didn�t make that sale. In fact, a letter came from them a day later that said, �Based on our short exposure to the people in Simi Valley, we�re staying where we live!� </p><p> Around that time, I found out there was such a thing as sales training. I invested my last $150 of savings on a seminar to learn how to sell. If that didn�t work, I was going to quit for sure. I was amazed by the things I learned at that seminar. Now that I could see where I�d been going wrong, I started getting my enthusiasm back. I took notes and memorized them until my brain ached. Once I was able to apply the material, I was thrilled with the results. My career really started turning around. </p><p> Hopefully, you will never have as terrible a day as I did. Unfortunately, some of your days may be just as bad or, even worse. What�s important is to anticipate those days and learn in advance the best ways to handle them. You�ve made the first important step just by picking up this book. By reading and internalizing this material, you can become more prepared to meet the daily challenges of a career in real estate and succeed. </p><p> As a real estate salesperson, you are paid in direct proportion to your ability to communicate with people and serve their needs. If you can�t do that, you�ll go nowhere in this business�fast. I�m assuming you�ve already learned that lesson the hard way and that�s part of the reason why you are now reading this book. You want to learn how to become a real estate professional. </p><p> Every profession has certain tools, which, once mastered, will allow you the opportunity to become one of the great ones in that field. For example, a professional golfer is paid in direct proportion to his or her ability to take a piece of steel at the end of a stick and bring it down to touch a small, white ball at the right time and place to send it hundreds of yards, eventually dropping into a small hole. Someone like Tiger Woods is a very successful professional because he has mastered the use of his tools. </p><p> A professional fighter is paid for how well he uses his fists; a surgeon�a scalpel; a carpenter must master the use of saws, hammers, and power tools. The people in each of these lines of work develop their skills through years of study, practice, and experience before they consider themselves professionals. If they�re smart, they learn not only by their own experiences but through the experiences of others. </p><p> The same thing applies to you in real estate. You can�t become a real estate professional without learning what one does, can you? My goal in this book is to make you realize that you�re no different from any other professional. As a real estate agent, you must primarily learn how to use your eyes, ears, and mouth because one of your most important tools is your ability to create exciting, colorful images, thus leading people to the decision to own real estate. </p><p> You see, selling real estate is no different from any other profession. As I mentioned above, people in most professional fields are paid in direct proportion to the amount of service they give. You, as a real estate salesperson, are as professional as the income you earn. So, in other words, if you�re not making enough money, you�re not giving enough service. </p><p> To learn how to give more service, you must learn from a professional�someone who has done what you want to do: real estate. The problem with too many people is that they are taking advice or �training� from people who are not professionals. How can they teach you something they�ve never accomplished themselves? Why would you want to learn from someone who�s not a top producer? I�m not saying you can�t learn from someone else, but be aware that you are limited to their experience. If they�re already way ahead of you because you�re new, go ahead and let them help you. However, once you begin to master what they teach, you�ll likely find yourself needing to learn from someone who is better at this business�that is if you plan to achieve the most you can from it. </p><p> You might be concerned about how well you�ll do in this business because you�re not a natural born salesperson. You just don�t have that gift of gab. Trust me, there�s no such thing as a natural born salesperson. All you�re doing if you accept that myth is keeping yourself from achieving your true potential. We all start out with pretty much the same abilities. It�s what we do with them along the way that counts. In other words, great salespeople are not born, they�re trained.

Adler's notorious Lexington Avenue house of prostitution functioned as a sort of social club for New York's gangsters and a variety of other celebrities, including Robert Benchley and his friend Dorothy Parker. According to one New York tabloid, it made Adler's name "synonymous with sin."<br><br>This new edition of Adler's autobiography brings back into print a book that was a mass phenomenon, in both hardback and paperback, when it was first published. A self-consciously literary work, A House Is Not a Home provides an informal social history of immigrant mobility, prostitution, Jewish life in New York, police dishonesty, the "white slavery" scare of the early twentieth century, and political corruption. <br><br>Adler's story fills an important gap in the history of immigrant life, urban experience, and organized crime in New York City. While most other accounts of the New York underworld focus on the lives of men, from Herbert Asbury's <i>Gangs of New York </i>through more recent works on Jewish and Italian gangsters, this book brings women's lives and problems to the forefront.<br><br><i>A House Is Not a Home</i> is compellingly readable and was popular enough to draw Hollywood's attention in the early 1960s&#x2015;leading to a film starring Shelley Winters as Adler. The book has been largely forgotten in the ensuing decades, lost both to its initial audience of general readers and to scholars in women's studies, immigration history, and autobiography who are likely to find it a treasure trove. Now, with a new introduction by Rachel Rubin that contextualizes Adler's life and literary achievement, A<i> House Is Not a Home</i> is again available to the many readers who have come to understand such "marginal" life stories as a special refraction of the more typical American success narrative.</p><p>"This is a truly important contribution to American history-in many fields: immigration, women's history, urban history, and cultural history. Rubin's introduction is wonderfully written and surveys, thematically, all the issues that should be covered."--Ruth Rosen, author of "Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America, 1900-1918" <p>"Rubin's introduction to this book is a major contribution to scholarship because it rescues from oblivion a vibrant and compelling immigrant story, presenting it from a new vantage point and allowing the reader to see the contradictions of the period Polly Adler lived through within a broadly painted historical context."--Elizabeth Ewen, author of "Immigrant Women in the Land of Dollars: Life and Culture on the Lower East Side, 1890-1925"</p>Polly Adler was born in Yanow on the Russian/Polish border in 1900, immigrated to New York City in 1912, and died in California in 1962. Rachel Rubin is associate professor of American studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston and author of <i>Jewish Gangsters of Modern Literature.</i></p><h2>Boss of Bosses: The Fall of the Godfather- The FBI and Paul Castellano</h2><p><b>&#x201c;At least as good as Mario Puzo, with shades of David Mamet or even Arthur Miller.&#x201d;&#x2014;New York <i>Daily News</i></b><br><br>Paul Castellano headed New York&#x2019;s immensely powerful Gambino crime family for more than ten years.

Riddles, chain riddles, and folk prayers, part and parcel of the "velorio along with folktales, are introduced at appropriate junctures. <br>The collection is unprecedented in size and scope, and most of the tales have not been translated into English before. The result is the first panoramic anthology of Hispano-American folk narratives in any language--meant to be dipped into at random or read straight through from "Once and twice makes thrice upon a time" to "They were happy as the dickens and ate chickens." <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>"A cornucopia of magic and myth. . . .

The definitive book for anyone wanting to learn how the best gemologists in the world evaluate precious gems, and what makes one stone merely a good stone versus a truly fabulous museum quality gem. The author, Richard Wise, is one of the world&#39;s foremost gemologists.</p><p>Richard Wise is the author of three books. &nbsp;His latest, <b>REDLINED</b>, a mystery/thriller set in Boston, was published by Adelaide Books in October 2019. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Called "One of the world's foremost gemstone connoisseurs," by Gemkey Magazine, Mr. Wise's first book, <b>SECRETS OF THE GEM TRADE, THE CONNOISSEUR'S GUIDE<i>...</i></b>published in 2003, became both a commercial and critical success and is now considered a classic. &nbsp;The second&nbsp;edition, extensively revised and rewritten with 127 more pages, 11 new chapters and 161 added photographs appeared in 2016.&nbsp;<br>Mr. Wise's second book, <b>THE FRENCH BLUE</b>, a historical novel published in 2010 won a 2011 International Book Award in Historical Fiction. The novel is set in the 17th Century gem trade. Called "a fine piece of historical fiction" in a 5 star review by Midwest Book Review, The French Blue tells the back story of the Hope Diamond and the true life adventures of 17th century gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier.&nbsp;Praise for the 1st Edition: "...very highly recommended to anyone interested in gemology as a superbly organized, authoritative, comprehensive and easy-to-follow reference.", <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>Praise for the 1st Edition: "A masterpiece, a tour de force. My recommendation, buy this book.", <i>Canadian Jeweler &amp; Orchid</i><br><br>Praise for the 1st Edition: "Unlike any other book I have read to date, unmasks the true criteria that expert gem dealers and collectors rely on for judging the quality of gem materials...The author's writing style and command of the subject matter keeps the reader captivated.", <i>Gem Market News</i><br><br>" I read the first edition as I was embarking on my first formal gemological training. Raised by a geologist father and growing up a rockhound, I had read extensively and thought I knew a lot about gemstones. I had many opportunities to see fine gems at trade shows, but was lacking an essential element in their evaluation - connoisseurship...Richard Wise opened my eyes to a whole new way of viewing gems.The second edition is better in many ways. There is much more of everything that made the first book great. Richard's definition of what is precious has expanded to include many new gems. Those of us who have always adored spinel will be pleased to see it featured as well as a new section on natural pearls-eleven new chapters in all...Visually stunning, the book is a much larger format, beautifully printed and coffee table worthy." -- Blaire Beavers, G.G., <i>National Association of Jewelry Appraisers (NAJA) and Pearl-Guide.com</i><br><br>"I received my copy of Secrets of the Gem Trade, Second Edition in Nov. 2016. The author has done an excellent job presenting valuable insights into the key factors that established quality and beauty of gemstones. In essence, Wise has placed in print the considerations that such experts gain through decades of experience in the market. As a gem industry analyst, I really enjoyed the revised edition. It is an excellent resource and an absolute "must" read for anyone interested in gems!" -- Stuart Robertson, President, <i>The Accredited Gemologists Association</i><br><br>The book is divided into Parts 1 and 2. Each chapter starts off with a relevant quotation, often by historic gem authors - a nice touch. In Part 1, the first seven chapters (90 pages) cover gemology, history, connoisseurship, enhancement and new sources. Wise redefines the 'Four Cs' (colour, cut, clarity and carat weight) by adding a fifth C: 'crystal'.Part 2 is titled 'A New List of Precious Gemstones'. It starts with Chapter 8, on page 91, with alexandrite and continues to page 361, Chapter 54, on cobalt-blue spinel. Throughout these chapters are numerous images of historic subjects, gem mining areas, gemstones and jewelry pieces. Notable photographers are given credits throughout....The book ends with a good glossary, a five-page bibliography and an extensive 16-page index to make finding information easy.Both editions of Secrets of the Gem Trade showcase Wise's passion for the gemstone world. This reviewer recommends this book to amateurs and professionals alike. -- William F Larson, FGA, <i>The British Gemmological Association - The Journal of Gemmology</i><br><br>"Richard is a great writer and storyteller. Clearly he is a man who loves his gemstones and what he does for a living. At times he is frank and to the point, while at other time there is playfulness in his writing.Sadly we work in an industry where many view education as a bad think. Content to believe what others have told them and perpetuate the falsehoods that have existed for generations. This is an industry that is not only secretive but based on trust. Many people have been quite content to put their own personal gains above all else and betray this trust. This industry needs the 'good guys' who are not afraid to tell it how it is. Richard Wise is one of these guys who has made it his personal mission, based on years of experience, to dispel these untruths and give his readers the tools they need to make informed decisions." -- Geoffrey M Dominy, <i>World Gem Foundation - Gemmology Today Magazine</i></p><h2>Superbody: How to Boost Your Immune System</h2><p>How to unlock your body&#39;s protective powers and defend yourself against infectious diseases and cancer.A healthy immune system doesn&#39;t just protect you against infection - it is an essential factor in your body&#39;s ability to fight off all other diseases - including cancer. The first two parts of this book explain why and how are bodies are under siege - and why the incidence of cancer and infectious diseases is rising rapidly (and likely to continue rising). Infectious diseases started to become resistant to antibiotics a quarter of a century ago. Since then the situation has steadily worsened and it is now probably too late for the medical profession to reverse the situation. Infectious diseases are coming back in a big way and the incidence of cancer is also going to continue to rise.

Despite a less-than-tragic food shortage and a secret crush or two, everything goes as planned. But a week later, they return home to find their houses empty and their pets starving. Something has gone wrong--horribly wrong. Before long, they realize the country has been invaded, and the entire town has been captured--including their families and all their friends.<br>Ellie and the other survivors face an impossible decision: They can flee for the mountains or surrender. Or they can fight.</p><p>John Marsden accidentally put himself through the perfect training to become a novelist. <br><br>He read vast numbers of books, acquired a love of language, and became insatiably curious about other people. He also had a variety of jobs, 32 at the last count, including working in abattoirs, hospitals, morgues and a haunted house. <br><br>In 1985, rather to his own surprise, he found himself teaching English in the Australian bush, at Timbertop School. Noticing a complete lack of interest in reading among his Year 9 students he tried his hand at writing a short novel that he thought they might enjoy. <br><br>The rest is history. John Marsden, author of the Tomorrow series and Ellie Chronicles, is now the world's most successful author of teenage fiction. He has sold a million and a half books worldwide, and has won awards in Europe, America and Australia. His first love however is still teaching, and he spends most of his time running writing camps at his property, near Hanging Rock, Victoria.The author combines a story of a WWIII invasion with a romance among several teenage couples. Narrator Suzi Dougherty�s voice has the raspy scratch of a heavy smoker and the accent of the Australian bush. She assumes the part of Ellie, a precocious student knocking on the door of adulthood who discovers that her town has been taken over by an unknown military. At first, Dougherty�s fast pace and Australian vocabulary of wombats, wallabies, and roustabouts may leave American listeners spinning, but with a little time she comes into focus. Her delivery of the dialogue of Ellie�s mates differentiates them more by their unique attitudes than by distinctive voices. Her narrative style and the author�s adroit descriptions create more entertainment than the thin plot.

He raised his hand to part my hair, seeking a solid grip on my neck, but as he did, I leapt to my feet, swinging around with the blade and leaving a deep cut in his side.<br><br>"No!" Now Sir Henry was rushing down the steps, his sword already out.<br><br>I swung back in the opposite direction, this time with a much better aim. I started to bring the blade down on Endrick's chest, but he grabbed my arm, using the grip glove to send a wave of pain through me. Had he not been injured, that pulse of magic probably would have stopped my heart.<br><br>I fell to the ground, gasping with breath. Endrick stood over me, clutching his wound and shouting, "A Dallisor child is the Infidante? Where did you find that blade?"<br><br>I couldn't speak, couldn't form words, but I stumbled to my feet, trying to put any distance between us.

Cockerill analyzes the book's rhetorical, chiastic shape and interprets each passage in light of this overarching structure. He also offers a new analysis of the epistle's use of the Old Testament -- continuity and <i>fulfillment</i> rather than continuity and discontinuity -- and shows how this consistent usage is relevant for contemporary biblical interpretation. Written in a clear, engaging, and accessible style, this commentary will benefit pastors, laypeople, students, and scholars alike.</p><p><b>Grant Osborne</b><br> -- Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br> "We are living in an age of incredibly good evangelical commentaries. Gary Cockerill's Hebrews is among the best, a first-rate work that is both readable and very deep. The centrality of rhetorical analysis and structural concerns adds a lot to the value of this work, and his insights about the use of the Old Testament in understanding the book's message are extremely helpful. . . . Readers will gain a fine understanding of this incredibly important epistle and its place in the life of the church."<br><br><b>I. Howard Marshall</b><br> -- University of Aberdeen<br> "It is no easy task to write a replacement for the work of such a scholar as F. F. Bruce on so demanding a book as Hebrews, but Cockerill amply justifies the trust placed in him by the editor of this series. In particular the attention that Cockerill pays to the author's use of the Old Testament and to the book's structure takes readers beyond Bruce's work. The exposition of the letter is profound and practical and yet so clearly presented that preachers will be particularly grateful for this volume."<br><br><b>David A. deSilva</b><br> -- Ashland Theological Seminary<br> "As in the best commentaries, this volume is more than a rehashing of scholarship; it is also a contribution to the same. Cockerill advances new proposals regarding the structure of the sermon and its author's hermeneutics of the Jewish Scriptures. Cockerill's Hebrews will proudly take its place alongside Attridge's, Lane's, and Koester's commentaries as an essential resource."<br><br><b>George H. Guthrie</b><br> -- Union University<br> "Gary Cockerill successfully integrates a thorough immersion in contemporary research on Hebrews with exegetical insight and pastoral sensitivity.

Suddenly, by lightly touching others with focused intent, he could make pain instantly disappear&#x2014; and, most astonishing of all, he could teach anyone how to do it. Now, for the millions of Americans looking for empowerment in an age of declining healthcare, Dr. Bartlett shares this scientific phenomenon in a book of explosive potential.</p><p><b>Richard Bartlett, DC, ND</b>, holds a degree in chiropractic and a degree in naturopathy from Bastyr University. After discovering his own extraordinary healing capabilities, Bartlett created Matrix Energetics as a system for helping others access their untapped potential. He is the author of <i>Matrix Energetics</i> and <i>The Matrix Energetics Experience,</i> and has helped thousands of people transform their lives through his national workshops and seminars.<p> <b>1 </b></p><p><b> The Birth of Matrix Energetics</b> </p><p> The little girl was three years old. She arrived with her mother at my chiropractic office at 6 pm, the last patient of a very exhausting day. I had driven four hours to get to my office in Livingston, Montana, that morning. The night before, I had stopped to sleep at a motel in Missoula, Montana, too exhausted to complete the drive from Seattle. I was enrolled in Bastyr Naturopathic University, taking a course load of thirty-one credits a semester in order to earn my degree in Naturopathy. Even with my heavy academic schedule, I still had to put food on the table for my family. I had not yet passed the Washington State Chiropractic board exam, which necessitated the bimonthly trek to Montana where my chiropractic practice was still flourishing, in spite of my very part-time schedule there. </p><p> Notwithstanding the title of "chiropractor," I had somewhat of a reputation in my local community for being this strange guy who practiced weird medicine. I was accustomed to unusual cases arriving at my doorstep. In this instance, the mother told me that her little girl had gone to the neurologist and had been diagnosed with a lazy eye. The doctor told her that there wasn't any treatment or surgery that he would recommend. If she wore an eye patch, maybe she would outgrow it by the time she was a teenager. The mother looked at me and said, "Well, that's not good enough for me. What do you think?" </p><p> I went into a deep trance, no doubt induced by sleep deprivation, and started babbling about a television episode of Superman that I saw in the 1950s. In this particular show, a little blind girl wins an essay contest sponsored by the <i>Daily Planet</i>. The prize is a trip around the world with Superman. When Clark, Lois, and Jimmy go to her New York apartment to meet her, Clark is stunned to find out that she's blind. Perplexed by this strange turn of events he asks, "Sweetheart, why would you want to fly around the world with Superman?" The child replies matter-of-factly, "Superman doesn't really exist, but I want the <i>Daily Planet</i> to fly Mommy around the world so she can find my Daddy." </p><p> In this episode, the girl's father Dan had been out for a nice weekend drive with his young family and had a terrible accident while swerving to avoid a pedestrian. The family car had run headlong into a corner lamp post, shattering the car's windshield and showering the occupants with shards of broken glass. </p><p> It was not immediately apparent after the accident that their young daughter could not see. She was an infant, so it was difficult to tell at first. The specialist they took her to confirmed the awful truth; she was totally blind. When asked what their options were, the doctor replied sadly that there was nothing he could do. In an effort to comfort the distraught parents, the doctor wistfully explained that sometimes blindness just goes away after a spell, but that they should not get their hopes up too high. </p><p> The family struggled to stay together in spite of the terrible stress and guilt the father had been experiencing ever since the incident. After many months of living with a crippling case of guilt, the man could bear it no longer. Every time he looked into his wife's eyes he saw accusation in her gaze. Unable to look at his daughter any longer, he left one night and never returned home. A friend, when queried, reported hearing Dan say that he was going to join the Foreign Legion or something. </p><p> Saddened to tears by this tragic story, Clark decides that there must be something he can do. What good is it to have super powers if you just have to stand by helplessly? He realizes that if he is going to do anything in this situation, he must start by convincing the little girl that he is indeed Superman. Spying an iron poker leaning against the fireplace, he walks over and brings it back to where she is quietly sitting. With gentle resolve he holds the iron implement out for her to feel, then gently places the rod behind her, and bends it slowly into a ring that encompasses her frail neck. Stunned, she whispers, "You <i>really are</i> Superman. No one else could do that!" </p><p> With a sad smile Superman replies, "Yes, I am, honey," and kneels down to gently reshape the steel poker into its original form. </p><p> As he kneels in front of her he notices with his X-ray vision that there is a little piece of glass in her eye, lodged near the optic nerve; perhaps that could be the cause of her blindness. Later that day Superman talks to a surgeon, who agrees to perform exploratory surgery (this is before lawyers, of course) in an attempt to restore the child's sight, assisted in the procedure by Superman's X-ray vision. </p><p> The little girl regains her sight and flies around the world with Superman. When they fly back through the window of her New York apartment, Mom and Dad are there holding hands like young lovers. (Superman has already found Dad and brought them together with the hope that they will reconcile if given a little interval of time.) Sigh. Another half hour of fantasy with the requisite happy ending. </p><p> As I finished telling the story, coming out of my sleep-deprived haze, I turned to the mother and said, "I have no idea why I just told you that." As I gazed at her, I noticed that standing to her right was none other than George Reeves as Superman! "I must be delusional," I thought, but there he was, a three-dimensional hologram, his red cape flapping in a non-existent breeze. I could have reached out and touched him. A beam of light traveled from his eyes to the little girl sitting on my exam table. With my inner sight, assisted by Superman, I saw a dark blockage of energy deep within the area of the brain that houses the connections for the optic nerve. </p><p> I've been used to strange things happening in my practice. In fact, I have come to rely upon incidences of intuition, "magic," or the seemingly miraculous to occur. But this was a little over the top, even for me! In my vision I saw a yellow ray streaming forth from Superman's eyes. Yes, I know X-rays can't be seen by the naked eye, but I had to be able to see the energy in order to know that something was happening. I decided that whether this was a powerful hallucination, a messenger, or something from <i>The X-Files</i>, it was obviously important. I resolved to pay close attention and do whatever seemed to be the most likely course of action. </p><p> I slowly realized that there was no way to reach the blockage. I couldn't get to it, and I doubted that the girl's mother would let me drill. I briefly considered using an intra-oral cranial technique, where you put your hand in the mouth and lift up on the plates of the skull to move it in that direction. That might have worked except that she was a three-year-old. I knew from a painful experience with my own son that if you stick your hand in a child's mouth it can scare them, and in response they tend to bite. </p><p> As I checked my conceptual bag of doctor's skills, I discerned no likely alternative. Maybe I was crazy, but I decided to go with the game plan of the big guy in blue with the red cape. I am a bit of a pragmatist, and weird or not, if an event like this occurs I know there is a good reason for it. I usually just go with my gut instinct, which in this case was fairly screaming at me to pay close attention and try something new. </p><p> I placed my right hand with index finger extended on the little girl's brow, right at the location where Superman's laser beam eyes were directing me. Suddenly, a beam of energy shot out of my hand, penetrated into her skull, and flashed into the area where I had intuitively noted the energy blockage. The blockage dissolved instantly! I could see this surging energy streak all the way across the terrain of her temporal lobes, into the occipital region of her brain. It then flowed down the neurological pathways involved with the processing of visual information. </p><p> Having completed its journey, this mysterious energy turned and shot back the way it had just traveled, coming to rest at the optic chiasm where the visual pathways from the eyes intersect. The child's eyes appeared to glitter and sparkle, and a moment later she proclaimed, "There are two of you!" Acting on a clinical hunch, I performed a visual test called "accommodation," and confirmed what I had suspected; she was seeing normally for the first time. All evidence of the "lazy eye" had vanished. As strange as this tale may sound, this marked the birth of what later came to be called Matrix Energetics. </p><p> <b>An Answer to a Prayer</b> </p><p> Just because the energy I call Matrix Energetics discovered me, or I appear to be the one who made it up, this doesn't in any way suggest that this ability wasn't in the universe long before my experience in 1997. Countless energetic forces pass through our bodies and energy fields at every moment of our lives. We may not have developed the sensory acuity necessary to detect them with our physical senses, but that doesn't mean they are not there. </p><p> At this very moment, how many frequencies or bandwidths are passing right through our bodies? Think about it. There are radio broadcasts, TV programs, cell phone conversations, and microwave transmissions all around us, to name just a few. Information, in the form of frequencies and waves, continually inundates us. In order to pick up this information, all we need is a receiver apparatus and an antenna. There is evidence to suggest that the unconscious mind serves as the receiver and our electromagnetic field functions as the antenna. Our need or desire acts as a force of attraction, which programs our awareness to seek out experiences or information. That's one reason I think the experience of what I have chosen to call Matrix Energetics happened to me. I had a desperate need and a burning desire, and I called out to the heavens for assistance. Something heard and responded in a way I never could have imagined. </p><p> What I had been doing in my chiropractic practice at the time was no longer working very well for me. My hands had been...</p></p><h2>Abran paso a los patitos</h2><p><b>The Spanish translation of <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i>, the Caldecott Award-winning classic picture book by Robert McCloskey!</b><br><br>El senor Pato y la senora Pata saben que el Jardin Publico de Boston es el lugar perfecto para criar a su familia.

Gone are the days when the cook is expected to labor alone in the kitchen while family or guests wait for their meal. In the Redzepi home everyone gravitates toward the kitchen to socialize, help, or graze on tasty bites while dinner is prepared, and Nadine wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her culinary mantra &#x2013; pair the very best ingredients with restaurant-inflected techniques that make the most of out their inherent flavors -- puts deliciousness at home well within reach for cooks of <i>all</i> levels. In Nadine&#x2019;s confident hands, weeknight mainstays like tomato bruschetta, pan-seared pork chops, slow-roasted salmon, or dark, fudgy brownies feel new again. Each recipe is studded with tips to help cooks build confidence and expertise as they cook, as well as restaurant-ready techniques that contribute precision, flavor, and plate appeal to even down-to-earth preparations. With a newfound mastery of essential building blocks like homemade mayonnaise and beurre blanc, a flavorful tomato sauce, or a genius do-it-all cake batter that can be reinvented in a myriad of ways, creating showstoppers like White Asparagus with Truffle Sauce; Rotini with Spicy Chicken Liver Sauce; or a decadent Giant Macaron Cake &#x2013; just as Nadine does on a daily basis--soon becomes second nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Downtime</i> is a celebration of the joys of cooking well &#x2013;and making it look easy while you do it, an aspirational guide for any cook ready to take their home cooking to the next level without sacrificing ease or enjoyment in the process.</p><p><b>Nadine Levy Redzepi&nbsp;</b>is an enthusiastic home cook, a mother of three, and has spent most of her adult life working with her husband, Ren� Redzepi, at the restaurant Noma in Copenhagen.<b>CHEESE RAVIOLI WITH BROWN-BUTTER EGG YOLKS, PARMESAN, AND SAGE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Serves 4<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>For a pantry meal, this has a lot of plate appeal. You can trace its roots back to a dish that was served at Noma featuring an egg yolk cured in beef juice. I found I could approximate the creamy, unctuous quality in a way that was more practical for a home kitchen by bathing the yolk in brown butter. I got the idea of pairing the yolk with ravioli one night when we had unexpected dinner guests and not a lot in the fridge. Fortunately, the combination turned out to be fantastic, and if you have good-quality cheese ravioli in the freezer (get the oversized ones if possible), this comes together quickly in a rather impressive way. It&#x2019;s quite rich, so I serve it as an entr�e rather than a starter, with just a simple salad.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Large egg yolks | 4<br> Salted butter | � cup (1 � sticks; 165 grams)<br> Coarse sea salt<br> Large cheese ravioli | 16<br> Fresh sage sprigs | 2 or 3<br> Extra-virgin olive oil | For serving<br> Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese | 1 (6-ounce/170-g) chunk<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Separate the eggs, dropping each yolk into its own small bowl. Cut the butter into tablespoons and place in a medium saucepan. Melt the butter over medium heat until foamy. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the butter smells nutty and the milk solids at the bottom turn light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately remove the brown butter from the heat. Carefully divide the butter among the 4 bowls, pouring it down the sides of the bowl, to cover the yolks entirely. Set aside for about 20 minutes.<br> <i>Do not pour the butter directly onto the fragile yolks or they may break.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> 2. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add a tablespoon or so of salt. Add the ravioli and cook according to the package directions until they float to the top of the water and are tender. Cut the sage leaves into thin shreds.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. Drain the ravioli well and arrange 4 on each plate. Gently slip an egg yolk onto the center of each portion and drizzle the brown butter over all. Sprinkle with the basil and sage. Grate as much Parmigiano as you like on top. Serve immediately, offering olive oil at the table for drizzling.<br><br><b>CONGRATULATIONS: YOU CAN MAKE BROWN BUTTER</b><br> Brown butter will keep, tightly covered in the fridge, for about a week, so if you are making some for this sauce, it&#x2019;s easy to make a double batch and store half in a glass jar. The brown sediment will settle to the bottom of the jar, so before you use it, let it come to room temperature, stir to recombine, then:<br> � Make the roasted celery root on page 201.<br> � Smear it on a piece of bread.<br> � Drizzle it onto soup as a garnish.<br> � Serve it with fried or baked fish.<br> � Toss it with hot boiled potatoes and chopped dill or other herbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> You can also cut the chilled brown butter into small cubes and use it to flavor vanilla ice cream, which is spectacular. Add it just before the ice cream is fully frozen, letting the paddle incorporate the bits into the custard.</p><h2>The Chaparral Shrublands of Southern California: A Folding Pocket Guide to Familiar Plants &amp; Animals (Wildlife and Nature Identification)</h2><p>Chaparral, the shrub-dominated landscape found in-between the coast and the mountains, is California's most extensive ecosystem and can be found in every single county in the state.

It details the keys of style that distinguish the best scientific presentations.</p><p><p><i>The Craft of Scientific Presentations, 2nd edition</i> aims to strengthen you as a presenter of science and engineering. The book does so by identifying what makes excellent presenters such as Brian Cox, Jane Goodall, Richard Feynman, and Jill Bolte Taylor so strong. In addition, the book explains what causes so many scientific presentations to flounder.<br><br>One of the most valuable contributions of this text is that it teaches the assertion-evidence approach to scientific presentations. Instead of building presentations, as most engineers and scientists do, on the <i>weak </i>foundation of topic phrases and bulleted lists, this assertion-evidence approach calls for building presentations on succinct message assertions supported by visual evidence. Unlike the commonly followed topic-subtopic approach that PowerPoint leads presenters to use, the assertion-evidence approach is solidly grounded in research.<br><br>By showing the differences between strong and weak presentations, by identifying the errors that scientific presenters typically make, and by teaching a much more powerful approach for scientific presentations than what is commonly practiced, this book places you in a position to elevate your presentations to a high level. In essence, this book aims to have you not just succeed in your scientific presentations, but excel. </p><p>About the Author</p><p>Michael Alley has taught workshops on presentations to engineers and scientists on five continents, and has recently been invited to speak at the European Space Organization, Harvard Medical School, MIT, Sandia National Labs, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Simula Research Laboratory, and United Technologies.

It is brimming with timeless messages for us all.</p><p>Born in 1910 in Albania, Mother Teresa went to Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham, Dublin, in 1928 and from there to India where she began her novitiate. She taught geography in St. Mary&#39;s High School in Calcutta from 1929 to 1948 then, in 1950, started her own order, the Missionaries of Charity, to minister exclusively to the poorest of the poor. She has won many awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize, and has founded hundreds of homes throughout the world.INTRODUCTION<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I have had the great fortune to meet Mother Teresa on several occasions. Each time, I was struck by her deep love for God and overwhelming sense of peace. The desire to experience this peace is, in fact, what draws so many of us to her. Mother Teresa herself would respond, if asked, that it is not she who is the source of this peace, but God. With this book, all of us are welcome to seek the path to peace which she has followed in the hope that we may find the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> In an age of misplaced priorities, we may need to be reminded of the importance of faith in God and the joy to be received from experiencing this faith. It is a simple message, yet one many of us do not readily see. Too often, faith suffers under the burdens of the modern world. Yet, it is faith that gives each of us the strength to overcome our difficulties because God&#x2019;s love is enduring. We learn through faith that we are not facing our struggles alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> For almost fifty years, Mother Teresa has dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor. She has witnessed, in the slums of Calcutta, how God&#x2019;s love transforms lives. Where many others might see only suffering, Mother Teresa sees dignity. Indeed, it is the poorest, who are not consumed with worldly matters, who are most free to seek God&#x2019;s peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each of us has the opportunity to share in this peace. For many accustomed to a fast-paced world filled with anxiety, this may seem difficult at first, but this book offers us a guide. The path to faith begins with silent contemplation and prayer. Prayer frees us from worldly concerns and reminds us of God&#x2019;s constant presence in our lives. Once we are able to accept God&#x2019;s love through prayer, we will be able to share this love with others through service.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not all of us are called to serve in the particular way that Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity serve, but we are called to serve others in everyday life. It is not how much we do that is important; rather, it is the love with which our actions are performed that is most important. The smallest action, done with love, will lead us toward peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> The beauty of the messages in this simple volume is that they speak not only to Catholics but to people of all faiths. They are simple truths that transcend all boundaries of race, culture, and religion. They offer all of us a guide on the path to peace. As you read these words, I encourage you to open your hearts to God in prayer and to welcome His peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua<br> Archbishop of Philadelphia<br> &nbsp;<br> February 8, 1996<br> &nbsp;<br> THE SIMPLE PATH<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The fruit of silence is<br> PRAYER.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fruit of prayer is<br> FAITH.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fruit of faith is<br> LOVE.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fruit of love is<br> SERVICE.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fruit of service is<br> PEACE.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> THE FRUIT OF SILENCE IS PRAYER<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I always begin my prayer in silence, for it is in the silence of the heart that God speaks. God is the friend of silence&#x2014;we need to listen to God because it&#x2019;s not what we say but what He says to us and through us that matters. Prayer feeds the soul&#x2014;as blood is to the body, prayer is to the soul&#x2014;and it brings you closer to God. It also gives you a clean and pure heart. A clean heart can see God, can speak to God, and can see the love of God in others.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you are searching for God and do not know where to begin, learn to pray and take the trouble to pray every day. You can pray anytime, anywhere. You can pray at work&#x2014;work doesn&#x2019;t have to stop prayer and prayer doesn&#x2019;t have to stop work. Tell Him everything, talk to Him. He is our father, He is father to us all whatever religion we are. We are all created by God, we are his children. We have to put our trust in Him and love Him, believe in Him, work for Him. And if we pray, we will get all the answers we need.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without prayer I could not work for even half an hour. I get my strength from God through prayer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Start and end the day with prayer. Come to God as a child. If you find it hard to pray you can say, "Come Holy Spirit, guide me, protect me, clear out my mind so that I can pray." When you pray, give thanks to God for all His gifts because everything is His and a gift from Him. Your soul is a gift of God. If you are Christian, you can say the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer; if Catholic, the Our Father, the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Creed&#x2014;all common prayers. If you or your family have your own devotions, then pray according to them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Every night before you go to bed you must make an examination of conscience (because you don&#x2019;t know if you will be alive in the morning!). Whatever is troubling you, or whatever wrong you may have done, you need to repair it. Remember that God is merciful, He is the merciful father to us all. We are His children and He will forgive and forget if we remember to do so.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N</h2><p>The humorous adventures of Hyman Kaplan, the irrepressible student at the American Night Preparatory School for Adults, and his personal war with the English language.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another&#x2014;Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma � from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel.<br><br> Takahashi won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media such as anime, live-action TV series, and film. Takahashi's manga, as well as the other formats her work has been adapted into, have continued to delight generations of fans around the world. Distinguished by her wonderfully endearing characters, Takahashi's work adeptly incorporates a wide variety of elements such as comedy, romance, fantasy, and martial arts.

Known on both sides of the law as "the Corporation," the Cuban mob&#x2019;s power stemmed from a criminal culture embedded in south Florida&#x2019;s exile community&#x2014;those who had been chased from the island by Castro&#x2019;s revolution and planned to overthrow the Marxist dictator and reclaim their nation.</p><p>An epic story of gangsters, drugs, violence, sex, and murder rooted in the streets, <em>The Corporation</em> reveals how an entire generation of political exiles, refugees, racketeers, corrupt cops, hitmen, and their wives and girlfriends became caught up in an American saga of desperation and empire building.

One of the Cuban exiles on board was Jos� Miguel Battle, who had jumped at the opportunity to reclaim his country. But the Bay of Pigs invasion failed spectacularly, a betrayal that set in motion the creation of one of the most powerful and dangerous mobs in American history.</p><p>By the mid-1980s, the criminal underworld in the United States had become an ethnic melting pot; one of the most ruthless organizations was the Cuban Mob, led by Battle, known as El Padrino, the Godfather. Their primary criminal racket was a game of numbers known on the street as &#x201c;bolita,&#x201d; with coins wagered by average citizens adding up to billions of dollars for Battle. The organization&#x2019;s power stemmed from a criminal culture embedded in Florida&#x2019;s exile community and stretched to New York and New Jersey. It became known as &#x201c;the Corporation,&#x201d; and for decades it ruled supreme, even outstripping the Italian Mafia, until it all came crashing down in a crescendo of violence.</p><p>In <em>The Corporation</em>, T.

It boasted a �twelfth-�century church, an equally ancient bridge, and a weekly cattle market that supplied the butcher shops of Paris and, every Tuesday, left the medieval streets steaming with manure. There was little �else in Poissy except for the ancient priory of �Saint-�Louis, a walled convent that had once been home to an order of Dominican nuns. The nuns had been evicted during the French Revolution and the convent&#x2019;s buildings either demolished or sold to private buyers. But inside the enclosure remained an enormous, spired church almost a hundred yards in length and, close by, a grandiose �house with clusters of balconies, dormer windows and �pink-�bricked chimneys: a building sometimes known as the Grande Maison.<br><br>Ernest Meissonier had occupied the Grande Maison for most of the previous two de�cades. In his �forty-�eighth year he was short, arrogant and densely bearded: &#x201c;ugly, little and mean,&#x201d; one observer put it, &#x201c;rather a scrap of a man.&#x201d;2 A friend described him as looking like a professor of gymnastics, and indeed the burly Meissonier was an eager and accomplished athlete, often rising before dawn to rampage through the countryside on �horse�back, swim in the Seine, or launch himself at an opponent, �fencing �sword in hand. Only after an hour or two of these exertions would he retire, sometimes still shod in his riding boots, to a studio in the Grande Maison where he spent ten or twelve hours each day crafting on his easel the wonders of precision and meticulousness that had made both his reputation and his fortune.<br><br>To overstate either Meissonier&#x2019;s reputation or his fortune would have been difficult in the year 1863. &#x201c;At no period,&#x201d; a contemporary claimed, &#x201c;can we point to a French paint�er to whom such high distinctions �were awarded, whose works �were so eagerly sought after, whose material interests �were so guaranteed by the high prices offered for every production of his brush.&#x201d; No artist in France could command Meissonier&#x2019;s extravagant prices or excite so much public attention. Each year at the Paris �Salon &#x2013; the annual art exhibition in the Palais des �Champs-�lys�es &#x2013; the space before Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings grew so thick with spectators that a special policeman was needed to regulate the masses as they pressed forward to inspect his latest success. Collected by wealthy connoisseurs such as James de Rothschild and the Duc d&#x2019;Aumale, these paintings proved such lucrative investments that Meissonier&#x2019;s signature was said to be worth that of the Bank of France. &#x201c;The prices of his works,&#x201d; noted one awestruck art critic, &#x201c;have attained formidable proportions, never before known.&#x201d;<br><br>Meissonier&#x2019;s success in the auction rooms was accompanied by a chorus of critical praise �and &#x2013; even more unusual for an art world riven by savage rivalries and piffling �jealousies &#x2013; the respect and admiration of his peers. &#x201c;He is the incontestable master of our epoch,&#x201d; declared Eug�ne Delacroix, who predicted to the poet Charles Baudelaire that &#x201c;amongst all of us, surely it is he who is most certain to survive!&#x201d; Another of Meissonier&#x2019;s friends, the writer Alexandre Dumas <i>fils</i>, called him &#x201c;<i>the</i> paint�er of France.&#x201d; He was simply, as a newspaper breathlessly reported, &#x201c;the most renowned artist of our time.&#x201d;<br><br>From his vantage point at the top of his mansion this most renowned artist could have seen all that his tremendous success had bought him. A stable �housed his eight �horses and a coach �house his fleet of carriages, which included expensive landaus, berlines, and victorias. He even owned the fastest vehicle on the road, a mail coach. All �were decorated, in one of his typically lordly gestures, with a crest that bore his most fitting motto: <i>Omnia labor</i>, or &#x201c;Everything by work.&#x201d; A green�house, a saddlery, an En�glish garden, a photographic workshop, a duck pond, lodgings for his coachman and groom, and a meadow planted with cherry �trees &#x2013; all �were ranged across a patch of land sloping down to the embankments of the Seine, where his two yachts �were moored. A dozen miles upstream, in the Rue des Pyramides, a fashionable street within steps of both the Jardin des Tuileries and the Louvre, he maintained his Paris apartment.<br><br>The Grande Maison itself stood between the convent&#x2019;s Gothic church and the remains of its ancient cloister. Meissonier had purchased the �pink-�bricked �eighteenth-�century orangery, which was sometimes known as Le Pavillon �Rose, in 1846. In the ensuing years he had spent hundreds of thousands of francs on its expansion and refurbishment in order to create a splendid palace for himself and his family. A turret had been built above an adjoining cottage to �house an enormous cistern that provided the Grande Maison with running water, which was pumped through the �house and garden by means of a steam engine. The �house also boasted a luxurious water closet and, to warm it in winter, a central heating system. A billiard room was available for Meissonier&#x2019;s rare moments away from his easel.<br><br>Yet despite these modern con�ve�niences, the Grande Maison was really intended to be an exquisite antiquarian daydream. &#x201c;My �house and my temperament belong to another age,&#x201d; Meissonier once said. He did not feel at home or at ease in the nineteenth century. He spoke unashamedly of the &#x201c;good old days,&#x201d; by which he meant the eighteenth century and even earlier. He detested the sight of railway stations, �cast-�iron bridges, modern architecture and recent fashions such as frock coats and top hats. He did not like how people sat �cross-�legged and read newspapers and cheap pamphlets instead of �leather-�bound books. And so from the outside his �house&#x2013;all gables, pitched roofs and leaded �windows &#x2013; was a vision of �eighteenth-�century elegance and tranquillity, while on the inside the rooms �were decorated in the style of Louis XV, with expensive tapestries, armoires, embroidered fauteuils, and carved wooden balustrades.<br><br>The Grande Maison included not one but, most unusually, two large studios in which Meissonier could paint his masterpieces. The <i>atelier d&#x2019;hiver</i>, or &#x201c;winter workshop,&#x201d; featuring bay windows and a large fireplace, was on the top floor of the �house, while at ground level, overlooking the garden, he had built a �glass-�roofed annex known as the <i>atelier d&#x2019;�t�</i>, or &#x201c;summer workshop.&#x201d; Both abounded with the tools of his trade: canvases, brushes and easels, but also musical instruments, suits of armor, bridles and harnesses, plumed helmets, and an assortment of halberds, rapiers and �muskets &#x2013; enough weaponry, it was said, to equip a company of mercenaries. For Meissonier&#x2019;s paintings �were, like his �house, recherch� figments of an antiquarian imagination. He specialized in scenes from �seventeenth- and �eighteenth-�century life, portraying an �ever-�growing cast of �silk-�coated and �lace-�ruffed �gentlemen &#x2013; what he called his <i>bonshommes</i>, or &#x201c;goodfellows&#x201d; &#x2013; playing chess, smoking pipes, reading books, sitting before easels or double basses, or posing in the uniforms of musketeers or halberdiers. These musicians and bookworms striking their quiet and reflective poses in serene, softly lit interiors, all executed in microscopic detail, bore uncanny similarities to the work of Jan Vermeer, an artist whose rediscovery in the 1860s owed much to the ravenous taste for �Meissonier &#x2013; and one whose tremendous current popularity approaches the enthusiastic esteem in which Meissonier himself was held in �mid-�nineteenth-�century France.<br><br>Typical of Meissonier&#x2019;s work was one of his most recent creations, <i>Halt at an Inn</i>, owned by the Duc de Morny, a wealthy art collector and the illegitimate half brother of the French Emperor, Napoleon III. Completed in 1862, it featured three �eighteenth-�century cavaliers in tricorn hats being served drinks on �horse�back outside a �half-�timbered rural tavern: a charming vignette of the days of old, without a railway train or top hat in sight. Meissonier&#x2019;s most famous painting, though, was <i>The Brawl</i>, a somewhat less decorous scene depicting a fight in a tavern between two men �dressed &#x2013; as �usual &#x2013; in opulent �eighteenth-�century attire. Awarded the Grand Medal of Honor at the Salon of 1855, it was owned by Queen Victoria, whose husband and consort, Prince Albert, had prized Meissonier above all other artists. At the height of the Crimean War, Napoleon III had purchased the work from Meissonier for 25,000 �francs &#x2013; eight times the annual salary of an average factory �worker &#x2013; and presented it as a gift to his ally across the Channel.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Bibliophile Notebook Collection: Book Club Favorites</h2><p>This bundle of notebooks features colorful book stacks straight from Jane Mount's <em>Bibliophile</em>, from Book Club Fans, to Timeless Classics, and a Sense of Place, each notebook cover has books that readers know and treasure.

The last page reveals the missive's contents&#x2014;an invitation to go exploring, something the note's author has been doing all along while waiting for a friend to arrive. Boyd's stylized gouache illustrations are reminiscent of Matisse's cutouts, with their vivid colors and dancing shapes. Sharp-eyed readers will enjoy spotting the animals on the spreads as they make their appearance and cameos throughout the story. Hand-lettered text is a fitting accompaniment to the images both in its simple refrain of "I wrote you a note. Did you find it?" and in making the entire book feel like the note itself.

I have written this book in the conviction that social peace can never be permanently achieved so long as individuals engage in civil war with themselves." <p>"In this book I try to present some answers that have proved helpful to me about the universal human dilemmas of conscience, love, fear, grief, and God-- crucial problems that present themselves in every kind of society, and, I believe, will present themselves as long as man is man." --Joshua Loth Liebman</p></p><p></p><h2>The Witch of Hebron: A World Made by Hand Novel (World Made by Hand Novels)</h2><p>Renowned social commentator and best-selling author James Howard Kunstler&#x2019;s sequel to <i>World Made by Hand</i>, expands on his vision of post-oil society in America in this suspenseful, darkly amusing story with touches of the fantastic in the mode of Washington Irving&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>).<br><br>In the tiny hamlet of Union Grove, New York, the electricity has flickered off, the Internet is a distant memory, and the government is little more than a rumor. Travel is horse-drawn and farming is back at the center of life, but Union Grove is no pastoral haven. Wars are fought over dwindling resources and illness is a constant presence. Bandits roam the countryside, preying on the weak and a sinister cult threatens to shatter the town&#x2019;s fragile stability.<br><br>In a novel that is both shocking yet eerily convincing, Kunstler seamlessly weaves hot-button issues such as the decline of oil and the perils of climate change into a compelling narrative of violence, religious hysteria, innocence lost, and love found.</p><p>James Howard Kunstler was born in New York City in 1948. He is the author of eleven novels and three nonfiction books, <i>The Geography of Nowhere</i>,<i> Home From Nowhere</i>, and <i>The Long Emergency</i>. He lives in upstate New York.<br>The post-oil America Kunstler envisioned in A World Made by Hand (2008) proved intriguing enough to inspire a sequel, which, in turn, portends a longer series. Having established the parameters of a society bereft of government services, automobiles, public utilities, consumer goods, and computers, Kunstler writes with more finesse in this portrayal of a community of survivors in Upstate New York, an old-fashioned yarn of character-building confrontations between humans and the wild, outlaws and decent folks. Kunstler decries our refusal to face facts about our oil habit, dramatizes how quickly &#x201c;the great thrumming engine of modernity&#x201d; can be halted, and celebrates the benefits of living intimately with nature. But his social concerns never overburden the suspenseful, darkly amusing story, with its touches of the fantastic in the mode of Washington Irving, or undermine his seductive characters: plucky young Jasper, the doctor&#x2019;s son; ludicrous bandit and psychopath Billy Bones; a sexy and accomplished witch; and the gruff leader of the bizarre and prosperous New Faith commune who possesses his own supernatural powers. Future installments will be eagerly anticipated. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The Rescuer (The O&#39;Malley Series #6)</h2><p>Stephen O'Malley is a paramedic who has been rescuing people all his life.

He is shadowed by his relatives&#39; carefully guarded memories of past trauma: the brutal Turkish extermination in 1915 of more than a million Armenians, including most of his maternal grandmother&#39;s family. Balakian seamlessly interweaves personal and historical material to depict one young man&#39;s reclamation of his heritage and to scathingly indict the political forces that conspired to sweep under the rug the 20th century&#39;s first genocide.One of the <b>Los Angeles Times</b> "Best Books of 1997"<p>"All the best memoirs belong to the literature of quest....Peter Balakian's <i>Black Dog of Fate is such a book."<br>--<b>Houston Chronicle</b></i></p><p><i>"Written with great sensitivity, <b>Black Dog of Fate</b> is at once a family memoir, a history of the extermination of the Armenians in Turkey, and the story of a young man's passage into adulthood....A fascinating and affecting memoir."<br>--<b>New York Times Book Review</b></i></p><p><i>"A landmark chapter in the literature of witness. . . .

He decides to set out and see the world. <br>As Charlie wanders, he meets one group of animals after another, playing together and having fun. At each encounter, Charlie innocently asks if he might join in, and each time he gets the same reply: "No! Now giddadda here!" when Charlie asks why, he's told he's just an ugly caterpillar -- and not wanted. At first Charlie is mystified, then hurt, then finally begins to <i>feel</i> ugly. <br>As winter approaches, our friendless Charlie sighs and spins himself a cocoon. When spring arrives, the cocoon opens and out comes Charlie -- now a beautiful butterfly. Suddenly he's popular beyond his wildest dreams. Suddenly everyone wants him to be part of their group.

It also disrupts the rust crystals. But what about a bolt seized in a bigger item like a brake caliper? Expanding the bolt will disrupt the rust a bit, but that's about it, the bore won't get bigger. Some items are designed to act as a heatsink to keep the things cool. You'll need a very powerful, danergous heat source.</p><p>All this assumes there aren't inflammable liquids, flexible hoses or painted surfaces nearby. But vehicles are awash with flammable liquids and tend to have flexible hoses in the very places most likely to get rusty... brakes, exhausts and transmission components. Buildings always have varnished, painted surfaces and even plastics everywhere.</p><p><b>Longer Spanner</b>: This is the least likely to work. It usually ends one of two ways: rounding off at least two corners of the nut or bolt head, or shearing the bolt shaft. This assumes you even have room for a huge lever... or a small lever with a length of tubing threaded onto it and a heavy friend hanging off it!</p><p><b>Grinder</b>: The nuclear option. You accept you'll have ground-off bolt stump to extract, possibly paintwork to repair, and you grind the nut or bolt head off. As with the long spanner this assumes you have enough space for a large spinning disk next to the bolt. Also, showers of sparks and hot metal aren't a great combination with flammable liquids. In cramped spaces you may find yourself unable to slide the assembly off the stump without fouling on something else... You could have spotted that earlier, but when you're frustrated enough to reach this point, you generally don't.</p></p><p></p><h2>Prosperity</h2><p>2012 Reprint of 1936 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This book is designed as a series of twelve lessons. In each of the lessons the author has attempted to explain man&#39;s lawful appropriation of the supplies spiritually and electrically provided by God. When we understand and adjust our mind to the realm or kingdom where these rich ideas and their electrical thought forms exist, we shall experience in our temporal affairs what is called &#34;Prosperity.&#34; Born in 1854 on an Indian reservation near St. Cloud, Minnesota, Charles Fillmore spent much of his early life unsuccessfully speculating on real estate and traveling the country seeking a cure for his wife Myrtle&#39;s tuberculosis before cofounding the New Thought-based Unity movement with her. Their popular magazine, &#34;Unity,&#34; was first published in 1891. The Unity movement eventually oversaw multiple magazines and sponsored publications. Fillmore died in 1948.</p><p>Charles Sherlock Fillmore (August 22, 1854 &#x2013; July 5, 1948) founded Unity, a church within the New Thought movement, with his wife, Myrtle Page Fillmore, in 1889. He became known as an American mystic for his contributions to spiritualist interpretations of biblical Scripture. <br> <br> He met his future wife, Mary Caroline Page, known as Myrtle, in Denison, Texas in the mid-1870s. After losing his job there, he moved to Gunnison, Colorado where he worked at mining and real estate. He married Myrtle in Clinton, Missouri on March 29, 1881 and the newlyweds moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where Charles established a real estate business with the brother-in-law of Nona Lovell Brooks, who was later to found the Church of Divine Science. <br> <br> In 1889, Charles and Myrtle began publication of a new periodical, 'Modern Thought', notable among other things as the first publication to accept for publication the writings of the then 27-year-old New Thought pioneer William Walker Atkinson. In 1890 they announced a prayer group that would later be called 'Silent Unity'. In 1891, Fillmore's 'Unity' magazine was first published. Dr. H. Emilie Cady published 'Lessons in Truth' in the new magazine. This material later was compiled and published in a book by the same name, which served as a seminal work of the Unity Church. Although Charles had no intention of making Unity into a denomination, his students wanted a more organized group. He and his wife were among the first ordained Unity ministers in 1906. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore operated the Unity organizations from a campus near downtown Kansas City.</p><h2>Cloud Dance</h2><p>Journey across the heavens through thick cumulus clouds, wispy cirrus clouds, and wide stratus clouds as they dance through every season of the year.<br> Thomas Locker introduces young readers to the basic science of our natural world with brilliant illustrations and poetic prose.<br></p><p>THOMAS LOCKER has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the companion titles Water Dance and Mountain Dance. He lives in Stuyvesant, New York.Gr. 3-5. This picture book for older children follows <i>Water Dance </i> (1997) in what one hopes will be a long series. It blends Locker's spare, poetic, informative text with his well-known Hudson River school-style landscapes. The strength here, as with many of his works, is the way Locker lets his paintings do most of the talking. Austere lines of text ("High, wispy clouds race in the autumn wind" or "Fluffy summer clouds march in the blue sky") are complemented by art that goes beyond the call of illustrative duty to reveal the wonder and beauty of the sky in different seasons and under various meteorological conditions. The paintings speak eloquently of the complete, seamless quality of the elemental natural world. An informative section at the book's end, entitled "About Clouds," links the beauty to the science. With Locker's immediate stylistic connection to the Hudson River painters, <i>Cloud Dance</i> becomes a successful blend of fiction, science, and art. <i>Tim Arnold</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Noted scholar Kathleen Manning offers a fresh take on the models and lenses through which higher education can be viewed by presenting a full range of organizational theories, from traditional to current. Chapters discuss the disciplinary foundation, structure, metaphor, assumptions, characteristics, and other elements of each organizational theory and conclude with cases highlighting practical applications. Questions for discussion are provided at the end of each chapter and embedded in the cases to assist the reader in making connections to their practice. Manning&#x2019;s rich, interdisciplinary treatment enables readers to gain a full understanding of the perspectives that operate on a college campus and ways to adopt effective practice in the context of new and continuing tensions, contexts, and challenges. </p> <p><strong>New to this Edition</strong>:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>revised chapters with updated material and new references that reflect current higher education issues including climate change; </li> <p></p></ul> <ul> <p> </p><li>a new chapter on Institutional Theory, an expanded Feminist and Gendered chapter, and an enhanced Spirituality chapter;</li> <p></p></ul> <ul> <p> </p><li>new cases throughout to address contemporary issues, and a broader range of institutional types including Historically Black and Hispanic-Serving institutions and 2-year institutions;</li> <p></p></ul> <ul> <p> </p><li>additional theoretical topics including critical race theory, queer theory, and contemplative practices; </li> <p></p></ul> <ul> <p> </p><li>updated and enhanced questions for discussion and recommended readings.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p></p><b> </b><p><b></b>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Kathleen Manning</b> is Professor Emerita of Higher Education and Student Affairs at the University of Vermont, USA.</p><blockquote> <p><em>Praise for the 1st Edition<br></em>"This theory-rich volume is peppered with practical applications throughout, making it the tutorial that this generation of academic leaders, faculty, and graduate students need to understand and respond to routine and non-routine actions and events, on and off the campus."<br>&#x2015;George D. Kuh, Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor Emeritus of Higher Education, Indiana University</p></blockquote> <p>"Manning has precisely condensed, updated, and translated the germinal organizational theoretical texts and meticulously interpreted the material with an intuitively global lens. The cases in <i>Organizational Theory in Higher Education</i> provide a refreshing perspective on the current trends and issues impacting higher education.

Fred, a grizzly with a three-year winning streak, excels in all of the events&#x2014;fish catching, hula-hooping, and scaring humans. His terrific GRRRRR of a growl, however, is gold medal plus. Fred trains hard, wins, and has a wall full of medals to show for it. But this year, Fred has some competition from a newcomer, Boris, who sports a mustache and glasses on his large blue frame. His GRRRRR is reportedly the loudest ever. But he seems rather sneaky and has been seen around Fred's cave at night. Soon it's the morning of the contest, and there is trouble for Fred. He has lost his roar. Luckily, his animal friends&#x2014;Owl, Raccoon, Eagle, Beaver, and others&#x2014;join the search for it. Alas, they do not find his roar before the start of the competition. Boris is a worthy opponent, and he and Fred are tied going into the final event of the day. Boris scores a 10, but without a GRRRRR, Fred stands a good chance of losing. So, all his friends line up and produce the loudest GRRRRR for him that they can. They are so loud, it causes Boris to jump, and out of his sweater falls Fred's GRRRRR. A repentant Boris admits that he's new and he just wanted some friends. "I hoped that if people thought I was a winner, then maybe, sometimes, they might come around for dinner." Fred forgives him and suggests that they be friends, and gives Boris&#x2014;what else?&#x2014;a bear hug. Biddulph's artwork was created with pencil, digital devices, and software. The nonproportional and cartoonish animals lighten the mood and add to the humor. The overall impression is upbeat. VERDICT Not the most original concept, and the plot is rather predictable. However, the message in this rhyming tale about friendship and acceptance is sweet and endearing; this title should find an appreciative audience.&#x2014;Roxanne Burg, Orange County Public Library, CA</p><h2>Shroom: A Cultural History of the Magic Mushroom</h2><p><blockquote><p>Did mushroom tea kick-start ancient Greek philosophy? <br>Was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a thinly veiled psychedelic mushroom odyssey? <br>Is Santa Claus really a magic mushroom in disguise?</p></blockquote><p>The world of the magic mushroom is a place where shamans and hippies rub shoulders with psychiatrists, poets, and international bankers. Since its rediscovery only fifty years ago, this hallucinogenic fungus, once shunned in the West as the most pernicious of poisons, has inspired a plethora of folktales and urban legends. In this timely and definitive study, Andy Letcher chronicles the history of the magic mushroom&#x2014;from its use by the Aztecs of Central America and the tribes of Siberia through to the present day&#x2014;stripping away the myths and taking a critical and humorous look at the drug's more recent manifestations.</p><p>Informative, lively, and impeccably researched, <em>Shroom</em> is a unique and engaging exploration of this most extraordinary of psychedelics.</p></p><p><p>Andy Letcher is a freelance writer, lecturer, and musician with a doctorate in ecology from Oxford University, and a second in religious/cultural studies from King Alfred's College, Winchester. He lives in Oxford, England, and sings and plays the mandolin and English bagpipes in his own acid folk group, Telling the Bees.</p>Letcher, an eco-protestor who once lived in a tree house, wrote this exhaustive history in order to debunk the folklore in which mushroom munchers have rooted their appreciation of the hallucinogen. The "bemushroomed," he says, proselytize that the fungus inspired humans to construct Stonehenge, found Western philosophy and even think up Santa Claus. To demonstrate that the real story is "less fanciful and far more interesting," Letcher draws on biological and archeological studies, social history and even his own diaries to chronicle phenomena like Algerian cave drawings that look suspiciously like mushrooms and the plight of Siberian shamans. But he often buries his best material. It's startling, for example, to learn that a New York City banker helped kick-start the psychedelic '60s with a <i>Life</i> magazine article about Mexican mushrooms. But Letcher digresses for 18 pages before finally delivering the kicker: financier Gordon Wasson engaged in a grave deception to gain access to the goods and declared himself blameless as hippie hordes destroyed the ancient community Huautla. Major figures like Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg appear, but are also subsumed by Letcher's colorless, academic style.

Discover how and why the government is corrupting scientific research.</b><br><br>When Speaker Newt Gingrich greeted Dr. David Lewis in his office overlooking the National Mall, he looked at Dr. Lewis and said: You <i>know</i> you&#x2019;re going to be fired for this, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I know,&#x201d; Dr. Lewis replied, I just hope to stay out of prison.&#x201d; Gingrich had just read Dr. Lewis&#x2019;s commentary in <i>Nature</i>, titled EPA Science: Casualty of Election Politics.&#x201d; Three years later, and thirty years after Dr. Lewis began working at EPA, he was back in Washington to receive a Science Achievement Award from Administrator Carol Browner for his second article in <i>Nature</i>. By then, EPA had transferred Dr. Lewis to the University of Georgia to await termination&#x2014;the Agency&#x2019;s only scientist to ever be lead author on papers published in <i>Nature</i> and <i>Lancet</i>.<br><br>The government hires scientists to support its policies; industry hires them to support its business; and universities hire them to bring in grants that are handed out to support government policies and industry practices. Organizations dealing with scientific integrity are designed only to weed out those who commit fraud behind the backs of the institutions where they work. The greatest threat of all is the purposeful corruption of the scientific enterprise by the institutions themselves. The science they create is often only an illusion, designed to deceive; and the scientists they destroy to protect that illusion are often our best. This book is about both, beginning with Dr. Lewis&#x2019;s experience, and ending with the story of Dr. Andrew Wakefield. This new edition, now for the first time in paperback, features a new introduction by the author.</p><p><b>David L. Lewis, PhD,</b> changed dentistry to a heat-sterilization standard worldwide in 1992 when his research at the University of Georgia showed that germicides recommended by the CDC and FDA could not prevent common dental devices from causing sporadic cases of HIV infection. As a veteran microbiologist in EPA&#x2019;s Office of Research &amp; Development, his medical and environmental research and commentaries on the politics of science have been covered in news articles and documentaries by every major media outlet, from <i>Reader&#x2019;s Digest</i> to <i>National Geographic</i>.&#x201c;David Lewis has been a beacon of integrity against the apocalyptical forces of ignorance and greed endeavoring to divert science from the noble pursuit of truth and pervert it into a tool that supports the most destructive policies of industry and government.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.<br><br> &#x201c;At a time when every aspect of our daily lives is touched by science it must be of concern that segments of the public have lost trust in it and are rejecting well-established scientific facts, such as climate change. While there are many contributing factors, Dr. Lewis turns the spotlight on the role of governments and scientific institutions. His book is certain to provoke discussion and deserves to be considered carefully.&#x201d; &#x2014;Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, Chair, Dept. of Cognitive Psychology, University of Bristol, UK</p><h2>Underwater &amp; Underground Bases: Surprising Facts the Government Does Not Want You to Know</h2><p>Dr. Richard Sauder�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s second book Underwater and Underground Bases is an explosive, eye-opening sequel to his best-selling, Underground Bases and Tunnels: What is the Government Trying to Hide? Dr. Sauder lays out the amazing evidence and government paper trail for the construction of huge, manned bases offshore, in mid-ocean, and deep beneath the sea floor! Bases big enough to secretly dock submarines! Official United States Navy documents, and other hard evidence, raise many questions about what really lies 20,000 leagues beneath the sea. Many UFOs have been seen coming and going from the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s oceans, seas and lakes, implying the existence of secret underwater bases. Hold on to your hats: Jules Verne may not have been so far from the truth, after all! Dr. Sauder also adds to his incredible database of underground bases onshore. New, breakthrough material reveals the existence of additional clandestine underground facilities as well as the surprising location of one of the CIA�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s own underground bases. Plus, new information on tunneling and cutting-edge, high speed rail magnetic-levitation (MagLev) technology. There are many rumors of secret, underground tunnels with MagLev trains hurtling through them. Is there truth behind the rumors? Underwater and Underground Bases carefully examines the evidence and comes to a thought provoking conclusion!</p><p>Lives in Quito, Ecuador.</p><h2>The Art of Rest: Faith To Hit Pause In A World That Never Stops</h2><p>If you're feeling weary... wishing life were more sustainable... searching for a way to rest without feeling guilty... suspecting that you'd enjoy godly rest if only you knew what it was... look no further.<br><br> This warm, realistic, humorous book will show you how rest is different to what you thought it was, and more important than you've realized.<br><br> The world never stops. But you can. You need to. And it's wonderful. It's time to learn the art of rest.</p><p>Adam Mabry is Lead Pastor of Aletheia Church Boston, MA, a rapidly-growing downtown church. He is married to Hope and they have four children. Before planting Aletheia, they had planted two churches in Edinburgh, Scotland. Adam did his theological studies at Reformed Theological Seminary and is studying for a PhD at Aberdeen.How fascinating to read a book about one of the greatest challenges of our time, written by a man who once failed miserably in the face of that challenge. In these pages, Adam Mabry gives us what we most need a vision of rest tethered to God, rooted in the practical, and shot through with a humorous understanding of our work-addicted folly. This book is a gift!<br> --<b>Stephen Mansfield</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author; host of the Stephen Mansfield Podcast<br><br> In this brief book about a big problem, Adam helps us find our way back to rest in God. Highly recommended!<br> --<b>Ed Stetzer</b>, Billy Graham Distinguished Chair, Wheaton College, Illinois; author of <i>Subversive Kingdom</i><br><br> <i>The Art of Rest</i> was itself a welcome rest to this retired theologian living in Florida (the outro in this book will enable you to appreciate the reference). I disagree with Adam somewhat about the Fourth Commandment, but he is wonderfully right about, as he says, 96% of what the Bible says on rest. His writing is rich, clear, conversational, and vivid. It's as if he, Adam, were right there with you as you read. And Adam calls us to a lifestyle enabled by God's grace in Jesus, in which we can find rest in work as well as rest away from work.<br> --<b>Dr. John Frame</b>, Professor of Systematic Theology &amp; Philosophy, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, Florida<br><br> I have to admit, it made me laugh when I heard Adam was writing a book on rest. Adam is one of the hardest-working people I know, and he seems to have endless energy but that might be why he is the perfect person to write on this topic. He is a gifted writer with an important message for everyone rest is a gift that God wants you to enjoy. I pray that this book inspires you to learn the art of rest.<br> --<b>Steve Murrell</b>, President, Every Nation Churches &amp; Ministries; founding pastor, Victory Church, Manila, Philippines<br><br> Adam Mabry is a pastor and an evangelist who cares deeply about people. His book beckons us to look to Christ's promise to exchange the heavy burdens that vex our souls for the peace that passes all understanding.<br> --<b>Dr. Rice Broocks</b>, co-founder, Every Nation Churches &amp; Ministries; author of <i>God's Not Dead</i> and <i>Man, Myth, Messiah</i><br><br> Painful and freeing. Simultaneously, this book was painfully convicting because of my need for rest, but it was also joyfully freeing to uncover the path to freedom freedom from the tyranny of the urgent, freedom from the list of to-dos, and freedom from the pressure to see myself as a human doing, instead of a human being.<br> --<b>Daniel Im</b>, Director, Church Multiplication at NewChurches.com; author of <i>No Silver Bullets</i>; Teaching Pastor, The Fellowship, Nashville, Tennessee<br><br> We in the 24/7 world of the West have forgotten why and how to rest. As a result, we're over-extended and sleep-deprived. Our relationships are strained, our bodies suffer stress-induced disorders, and worst of all, our worship of God is superficial. We need help. And Adam Mabry's book is a great help. Here we get to the heart of the problem and then find very helpful recommendations for recovering the lost art of rest.<br> --<b>Jon Bloom</b>, co-founder, Desiring God; author of <i>Not By Sight</i><br><br> Read this to gain insight into the purpose behind the pillars of sabbath with which God architected man's soul. If you are allergic to conviction, read this book with your favorite antihistamine close by.<br> --<b>Brett Fuller</b>, Pastor, Grace Covenant Church, Chantilly, Virginia; North American Director, Every Nation Churches &amp; Ministries; Chaplain, Washington Redskins<br><br>This little jewel of a book made my heart sing. Like most of us, Adam Mabry has struggled with the modern tyranny of busyness. In this short book easily readable even by the busiest he shows the biblical principle of rest to be a gift of grace, a taste of heaven, and a counter-cultural statement of trust in our heavenly Father. An inspiring and challenging read!<br> --<b>Clare Heath-Whyte</b>, author of <i>Old Wives' Tales</i> and <i>Everyone a Child Should Know</i><br><br> In this excellent book, Adam Mabry shows us that rest for the Christian is not optional it's commanded for our good. After a careful handling of a biblical theology of rest, Mabry applies God's good command in a gospel-saturated and realistic way. This book will do you good and enable you to rest well in a restless world.<br> --<b>Robin Weekes</b>, Minister, Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon, UK<br><br> The modern world's frenetic pace and anxious striving too often pervade our Christian lives and church culture. Mabry's book is full of honest reflections, theological depth, and practical insights. Mabry does far more than provide a list of tips and rules; he reorients our desires, teaching us how to embrace rest from God's perspective.<br> --<b>Lionel Windsor</b>, faculty member at Moore College, Sydney; author of <i>Gospel Speech</i><br><br> We live in a world that has forgotten how to rest, so put your feet up, relax, and let Adam Mabry refresh your memory. This is a book whose time has come.<br> --<b>Phil Moore</b>, Lead Pastor, Everyday Church, Wimbledon, UK; author of <i>Gagging Jesus</i><br><br> Nobody teaches us to rest. Adam Mabry like many others discovered the consequences the hard way. This 'starter in the art of rest' explores why we find it hard to stop, and makes an urgent plea for us to discover patterns and rhythms of rest before the pace and complexity of life overwhelm us. This is a book I really wish I had read when I was starting in Christian ministry.<br> --<b>Marcus Honeysett</b>, Director, Living Leadership; author of <i>Fruitful Leaders</i><br><br> What a refreshing book! With surprising authenticity, delightful humor, and profound biblical insight, Adam Mabry has given Christians a gift... and a gift that will last a lifetime. It's not a book you just read; it's a book to which you will refer often and that over a lifetime. I'm an old guy and just wish that I had read this book when I was younger. But still, this book is a life-changer even for an old guy 'cramming for finals.' My life is going to be richer and better because of <i>The Art of Rest</i>. Yours will be too. Read it and give it to everyone you know!<br> --<b>Steve Brown</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author; host of <i>Steve Brown, Etc.</i> and <i>Key Life</i>; Professor, Reformed Theological, Orlando and Knox Seminary, Fort Lauderdale, Florida<br><br> I know this message is disruptive because it interrupts the auto-pilot default life-styles that we have taken for granted. I also know the messenger/author and what a difference practicing rest has made to him. His radical change gives me hope that leaders can lead from a place of rest, and the results are so much more sustainable.<br> --<b>Dr. Joseph Umidi</b>, Executive Vice President, Regent University</p><h2>The Christ of Christmas</h2><p>The Christmas story evokes many touching images.

Although I believe that both books were written at the same time, the second book is on a higher level than the last book.

Real enough to not be "fluffy-bunny" but not to hard for children to cope with or to understand."&nbsp; ~ PaganDad Patrick McCleary<br><br>"Kids will enjoy the stories, although you will probably only read one at a time to very young children, and they will grow into some of the deeper nuances. Adults will enjoy them too, although they may find some of the rhymes tumbling through their head long after they story was read. Heck, I'd give these books to someone interested in knowing more about pagan rituals, but daunted by reading books with 'witch' in the title.&nbsp; Highly recommended."&nbsp; ~ Lisa Mc Sherry, Facing North</p><h2>Spiritual Rhythm: Being with Jesus Every Season of Your Soul</h2><p>&#x201c;Abide in me,&#x201d; Jesus tells us, &#x201c;and you will bear much fruit.&#x201d; Yet too often we forget that fruit needs different seasons in order to grow. We measure our spiritual maturity by how much we do rather than how we are responding to our current spiritual season.In Spiritual Rhythm, Mark Buchanan replaces our spirituality of busyness with a spirituality of abiding. Sometimes we are busy, sometimes still, sometimes pushing with all we&#x2019;ve got, sometimes waiting. This model of the spiritual life measures and produces growth by asking: Are we living in rhythm with the season we are in? With the lyrical writing for which he is known, Mark invites us to respond to every season of the heart, whether we are flourishing and fruitful, stark and dismal, or cool and windy. In comparing spiritual rhythms to the seasons of the year, he shows us what to expect from each season and how embracing the seasons causes our spiritual lives to prosper. As he draws on the powerful words of Scripture, Mark explores what activities are suitable or necessary in each season&#x2015;and what activities are useless or even harmful in that season.Throughout the book, Mark weaves together stories of young and old, men and women, families, couples, and individuals who are in or have been through a particular season of the heart. As Mark writes, &#x201c;I pray that this book meets you in whatever season you&#x2019;re in, and prepares you for whatever seasons await. I pray that it helps you find your voice, your stride, your rhythm, in season or out. Mostly, I pray that you, with or without my help, find Christ wherever you are. And that, even more, you discover that wherever you are, he&#x2019;s found you.&#x201d;</p><p><p>Mark Buchanan is a professor and award-winning author.

On October 4, 1777, it was a small village on the outskirts of the colonial capital whose surrounding fields and streets witnessed one of the largest battles of the American Revolution. The bloody battle represented George Washington&#x2019;s attempt to recapture Philadelphia, but has long been overshadowed by better-known events like Brandywine, Saratoga, and Valley Forge. Award-winning author Michael C. Harris&#x2019;s impressive Germantown: A Military History of the Battle for the Control of Philadelphia, October 4, 1777, elevates this important action from obscurity in the first full-length study of this pivotal engagement.<br><br>General Sir William Howe launched his campaign to capture Philadelphia in late July 1777, with an army of 16,500 British and Hessian soldiers aboard a 265-ship armada sailing from New York. Six difficult weeks later, Howe&#x2019;s expedition landed near Elkton, Maryland, and moved north into Pennsylvania. Washington&#x2019;s rebel army did all it could to harass Howe and fought and lost a major battle at Brandywine on September 11. Philadelphia fell to the British.<br><br>On October 4, obscured by darkness and a heavy morning fog, Washington launched a surprise attack on the British garrison at Germantown. His early attack found initial success and drove the British legions before him. The recapture of the colonial capital seemed within Washington&#x2019;s grasp until poor decisions by the American high command brought about a reversal of fortune and a clear British victory. Like Brandywine, however, the bloody fight at Germantown proved that Continental soldiers could stand toe-to-toe with British Regulars. The Battle of Germantown began a protected quasi-siege of the British garrison in Germantown prior to the travails soon to come that winter at Valley Forge.<br><br>Harris&#x2019;s Germantown is the first complete study to merge the strategic, political, and tactical history of this complex operation and important set-piece battle into a single compelling account. Following up on his award-winning Brandywine, Harris&#x2019;s sweeping prose relies almost exclusively on original archival research and a deep personal knowledge of the terrain. Complete with original maps, numerous illustrations, and modern photos, and told largely through the words of those who fought there, Germantown: A Military History of the Battle for the Control of Philadelphia, October 4, 1777 is sure to please the most discriminating reader and assume its place as one of the finest military studies of its kind.</p><p>Michael C.

He has worked for the National Park Service in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Fort Mott State Park in New Jersey, and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission at Brandywine Battlefield.

Soon he is running with his old circle of friends through L.A.&#x2019;s seedy side. His ex-girlfriend, Blair, is married to Trent, a bisexual philanderer and influential manager. Then there's Julian, a recovering addict, and Rip, a former dealer. Then when Clay meets a gorgeous young actress who will stop at nothing to be in his movie, his own dark past begins to shine through, and he has no choice but to dive into the recesses of his character and come to terms with his proclivity for betrayal.</p><p><p><b>Donna Tartt is the author of the novels <em>The Secret History</em> and <em>The Little Friend</em>, and is currently at work on a third novel. Read her review of <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>As Dante&#x2019;s hell is circular, so is Bret Easton Ellis&#x2019;s L.A. Everywhere in <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em> there is a sense of time frozen, time collapsed and time rounding back on itself in various diabolical ways. The novel marks a return to the characters of <em>Less Than Zero</em>, twenty-five years on, where it&#x2019;s still the same old scene, camera flashes and sun-blinded gloss--only this time, there&#x2019;s a persistent echo of unease, the sadness of moving in a young world while no longer young in it. Clay, casting teenagers for his eighties period film, ominously named "The Listeners," finds himself eyeing the sixteen-year-old actors dressed in the style of his youth and thinking they are friends of his, though of course they aren&#x2019;t. His old friend Julian, affable as usual, is rumored to be running a teenage hooker service ("Like old times," as Clay comments acidly), while Rip, he of the trust fund that "might never run out," is in his middle age so disfigured from plastic surgery as to be practically unrecognizable, though he still has the whispery voice of the handsome boy he once was.</p> <p>This is the most Chandleresque of Bret&#x2019;s books, and the most deeply steeped in L.A. noir. No one is trustworthy; everyone is playing everyone else. Moreover, as in all Bret&#x2019;s novels, fiction collides with reality, and fiction with fiction. Clay is being followed, for reasons he comes to suspect may have to do with the girl he&#x2019;s fallen for. There are mysterious texts (from a dead boy? the previous tenant of Clay&#x2019;s apartment?) a message written in red on a bathroom mirror: <em>Disappear here</em>. Running throughout are cocktail-party rumors of vans in the desert, ski masks, chains and mutilations, mass graves, a videotaped execution, though--as will be no surprise to any reader of Bret&#x2019;s books---the rumors aren&#x2019;t entirely rumors, in fact, the truth is rather worse than anything one has imagined. But what stays with one is not so much the concluding note of betrayal and horror as the mournfulness of the book, its eerie sense of stasis: clear skies, vacuum-sealed calm, the BlackBerry flashing on the nightstand in the middle of the night, everywhere the subliminal hum of menace, while the surgically-altered Rip brings his lips close to the ear and whispers in a voice so quiet as to almost be swallowed by the surrounding emptiness: <em>Descansado</em>.

The twenty-five-year-old officer had been brought into the Scottish Military Hospital on June 15, 1941, paralyzed from the waist down. A letter to his mother from the War Office stated that he had suffered &#x201c;a contusion of the back as a result of enemy action.&#x201d;<br><br> This was not, strictly speaking, true. The injured soldier had not set eyes on the enemy: he had jumped out of a plane, without a helmet or proper training, ripped his parachute on the tail and plummeted to earth at roughly twice the recommended speed. The impact had knocked him out and badly injured his spine, leaving him temporarily blinded and without feeling in his legs. The doctors feared he would never walk again.<br><br> Even before his parachuting accident, the officer&#x2019;s contribution to the war effort had been minimal: he lacked the most basic military discipline, could not march straight, and was so lazy his comrades had nicknamed him &#x201c;the Giant Sloth.&#x201d; Since being posted to Egypt with the British commando force, he had spent much of his time in Cairo&#x2019;s bars and clubs, or gambling at the racecourse. The nurses at the hospital knew him well, for he frequently popped in during the morning, whey-faced and liverish, to request a blast from the oxygen bottle to cure his hangover. Before his parachute jump landed him in the hospital, he had been under investigation&nbsp;to establish whether he was malingering and ought to be court-martialed. His fellow officers found him charming and entertaining; his senior commanders, for the most part, regarded him as impertinent, incompetent, and profoundly irritating. On completing officer training, he had received a blunt appraisal: &#x201c;irresponsible and unremarkable.&#x201d;<br><br> Lieutenant David Stirling of the Scots Guards was not a conventional soldier.<br><br> The writer Evelyn Waugh, a fellow officer in the commando force, came to visit Stirling about three weeks after his admission to the hospital. Waugh had been misinformed by the matron that one of Stirling&#x2019;s legs had already been amputated, and he would likely lose the other. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t feel a thing,&#x201d; Stirling told his friend. Embarrassed, as Englishmen tend to be when faced with disability, Waugh kept up a steady stream of meaningless small talk, perched on the edge of the bed, and studiously avoided the subject of his friend&#x2019;s paralysis. Every so often, however, he would sneak a surreptitious glance to where Stirling&#x2019;s remaining leg ought to be, and whenever he did so Stirling, with extreme effort, would wiggle the big toe of his right foot. Finally, Waugh realized he was being teased, and hit Stirling with a pillow.<br><br> &#x201c;You bastard, Stirling, when did it happen?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Minutes before you came. It takes a bit of effort, but it&#x2019;s a start.&#x201d;<br><br> Stirling was regaining the use of his legs. Others might have cried for joy; for Stirling, however, the first sign of his recovery was an excellent opportunity to play a practical joke on one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest novelists.<br><br> It would take two more weeks before Stirling could stand upright, and several more before he was able to hobble about. But during those two months of enforced inaction he did a great deal of thinking&#x2014;something that, in spite of his reputation as a feckless gadabout, he was rather good at.<br><br> The commandos were intended to be Britain&#x2019;s storm troops, volunteers selected and trained to carry out destructive raids&nbsp;against Axis targets. Prime Minister Winston Churchill had decided that the ideal theater in which to deploy the commandos would be North Africa, where they could conduct seaborne raids against enemy bases along the Mediterranean coast.<br><br> In Stirling&#x2019;s unsolicited opinion, the concept was not working. Most of the time the commandos were inactive, awaiting the order for a great assault that never came; on the rare occasions when they were deployed, the results had been disappointing. The German and Italian troops fully expected to be attacked from the sea, and were primed and waiting. The commando forces were simply too large and cumbersome to launch an assault without being spotted; the element of surprise was immediately lost.<br><br> But what, wondered Stirling, if the combat troops attacked from the opposite direction? To the south, stretching between Egypt and Libya, lay the Great Sand Sea, a vast, waterless expanse of unbroken dunes covering forty-five thousand square miles. One of the most inhospitable environments on earth, the desert was considered by the Germans to be virtually impassable, a natural barrier, and they therefore left it largely unprotected, and entirely unpatrolled. &#x201c;This was one sea the Hun was not watching,&#x201d; Stirling reflected. If mobile teams of highly trained men, under cover of darkness, could be infiltrated onto the enemy&#x2019;s desert flank, they might be able to sabotage airfields, supply depots, communications links, railways, and roads, and then slip back into the embracing emptiness of the sand sea. A commando force several hundred strong could attack only one target at a time; but a number of smaller units, moving quickly, raiding suddenly and then retreating swiftly, could destroy multiple targets simultaneously. The opportunity to attack the enemy in the rear, when he least expects it, is the pipe dream of every general. The peculiar geography of North Africa offered just such a possibility, reflected Stirling, as he lay half paralyzed in his hospital bed, trying to wiggle his toes.<br><br> Stirling&#x2019;s idea was the result of wishful thinking more than expertise; it had emerged not from long hours of reflection and&nbsp;study, but from the acute boredom of convalescence. It was based on intuition, imagination, and self-confidence, of which Stirling had plenty, rather than experience of desert warfare, of which he had none. But it was an inspired idea, and the sort of idea that could only have occurred to someone as strange and remarkable as Archibald David Stirling.<br><br> Stirling was one of those people who thrive in war, having failed at peace. In a short life, he had tried his hand at a variety of occupations&#x2014;artist, architect, cowboy, and mountaineer&#x2014;and found success in none of them. Privileged by birth and education, intelligent and resourceful, he could have done anything, but had spent the early part of his life doing little of any consequence. The war was his salvation.<br><br> The Stirling family was one of the oldest and grandest in Scotland, an aristocratic clan of great distinction, long military traditions, and considerable eccentricity. David Stirling&#x2019;s mother was the daughter of Lord Lovat, the chief of Clan Fraser, with bloodlines stretching back to Charles II. His father, General Archibald Stirling, had been gassed in the First World War, served as an MP, and then retired to Keir, the fifteen thousand-acre Perthshire estate that had been the family&#x2019;s seat for the previous five centuries. The general presided over his sprawling lands and unruly family like some benign but distant chieftain observing a battlefield from a remote hill. David&#x2019;s formidable mother, Margaret, was the more forceful presence: her children were in awe of her. Keir House, where David Stirling was born in 1915, was a vast edifice, freezing cold even at the height of summer, filled with old hunting trophies, noise, and devilment. The Stirling parents drummed good manners into their six children, but otherwise largely left them to get on with their lives. The four Stirling boys, of whom David was the second in age, grew up stalking deer, hunting rabbits, fighting, and competing. One favorite game was a form of sibling duel using air rifles: two brothers would take potshots at each other&#x2019;s backsides in turn, moving closer by a pace after each shot.<br><br> Despite this aristocratically spartan start in life, David Stirling was not a hardy child. Dispatched to Ampleforth, a Catholic boarding school, at the age of eight, he caught typhoid fever and was sent home for an extended period of recovery. A speech impediment was eventually cured by surgery. He disliked sports, and did his best to avoid them. He grew at an astonishing rate: by the age of seventeen, he was nearly six feet, six inches tall, a gangly beanpole, willful, reckless, and exceptionally polite. Largely by virtue of his class, he was awarded a place at Cambridge University, where he misbehaved on a lavish scale, spending more time at Newmarket racecourse than he devoted to studying. &#x201c;If there was a serious side to life it totally escaped me,&#x201d; he later admitted. If he ever opened a book, the event was not recorded. After a year, the master of his college informed him that he was being sent down, read out a list of twenty-three offenses that merited expulsion, and invited him to select the three that he considered &#x201c;would be least offensive&#x201d; to his mother.<br><br> David Stirling decided he would become an artist, in Paris. He had little talent for painting. But he did have a beret, and a yen for the bohemian life. Some have detected &#x201c;a strange mixture of beauty and the macabre&#x201d; in his paintings. His French art tutor, however, did not, and after a year and a half of louche Left Bank life, he was told that while he might one day make a half-decent commercial draftsman, his &#x201c;painting would never achieve any real merit.&#x201d; Stirling was profoundly upset; his failure as an artist marked him forever, and perhaps explained the consistent ripple of insecurity that lay beneath the carapace of confidence.<br><br> He returned to Cambridge to study architecture, but soon dropped out again. A job with an Edinburgh architect was short-lived. His mother now intervened, and told her second son that he must stop drifting and do something with his life. Stirling&nbsp;announced that he intended to become the first person to climb Mount Everest.<br><br> Stirling was quite the wrong shape to scramble up rocks. He had little experience of serious climbing. He also suffered from vertigo. Intrepid British mountaineers had been trying to scale the world&#x2019;s highest mountain since 1921; dozens had perished in the attempt. Climbing Everest was an expensive, dangerous, demanding business, and Stirling was broke&#x2014;none of which dented his determination to succeed where other, qualified, experienced, well-funded mountaineers had failed. He spent a year climbing in the Swiss Alps, bankrolled by his mother, before joining the supplementary reserve of the Scots Guards, his father&#x2019;s regiment, in the hope that part-time army training might bolster his mountaineering quest. He soon drifted out of uniform, repelled by the mind-swamping boredom of the parade ground. In 1938, at the age of twenty-three, he went to the United States with the intention of climbing the Rockies and riding across the Continental Divide. He was south of the Rio Grande, having spent several months herding cattle in the company of a cowboy named Roy &#x201c;Panhandle&#x201d; Terrill when he learned that Britain was at war&#x2014;the run-up to which had, it seems, almost entirely passed him by. His mother sent a telegram: &#x201c;Return home by the cheapest possible means.&#x201d; Stirling flew to Britain on a first-class ticket, and rushed back into uniform.<br><br> The David Stirling who turned up at the Guards Depot in Pirbright in the autumn of 1939 was a strange mixture of parts. Ambitious but unfocused; steeped in soldierly traditions but allergic to military discipline. A boisterous exterior belied a man prone to periodic depressions, whose extreme good manners and social ease masked moments of inner turmoil. Stirling was a romantic, with an innate talent for friendship but little desire or need for physical intimacy. He appears to have lost his virginity in Paris as an art student. With Panhandle Terrill he had enjoyed the company of &#x201c;some of those dark girls down in Mexico.&#x201d; But his natural shyness coupled with a stern all-male Catholic education seems to&nbsp;have left him in fear of women. &#x201c;The totally confused, guilt-ridden years of puberty exerted an awful pressure,&#x201d; he once remarked. He spoke of &#x201c;predatory females&#x201d;; his few romantic encounters were described as &#x201c;close escapes,&#x201d; as if he feared entrapment. &#x201c;Bonds of any sort are a pressure I find very difficult to bear,&#x201d; he admitted. He had many women friends, and according to his biographer was &#x201c;not unattracted to the opposite sex.&#x201d; Yet he seemed to relax only among men, and &#x201c;in wide open spaces.&#x201d; Like many convivial people, he was slightly lonely. A warrior monk, he craved action and the company of soldiers, but when the fighting was over, he embraced solitude.<br><br> Stirling was also possessed of a profound self-belief, the sort of confidence that comes from high birth and boundless opportunity. He was blithely unconstrained by convention, and regarded rules as nuisances to be ignored, broken, or otherwise overcome. He was elaborately respectful toward his social inferiors, and showed no deference whatever to rank. Strikingly modest, he was repelled by braggarts and loudmouths: &#x201c;swanks&#x201d; (swanking) or &#x201c;pomposo&#x201d; (pomposity) were his gravest insults. His manner seemed vague and forgetful, but his powers of concentration were phenomenal. Despite an ungainly body and a patchy academic record, he had a stubborn faith in his own abilities, intellectual and physical. Stirling did exactly what he wanted to do, whether or not others thought his aims were sensible or even possible. The SAS came into being, in part, because its founder would not take no for an answer, either from those in authority or from those under his command.<br><br> Just as he had been bored by the logistics of mountaineering, so Stirling found the practical preparations for war indescribably tedious. Like many young men, he was hungry for the fight, but instead found himself shackled to a regime of endless marching, kit inspections, weapons drill, and all the other rote elements of military life. So he rebelled. Slipping away from the Guards Depot at Pirbright, he would frequently head to London for a night of drinking, gambling, and billiards at White&#x2019;s club; just as frequently&nbsp;he was caught, and confined to barracks. Stirling was a nightmare recruit: impertinent, indolent, and often half asleep as a result of his carousing the night before. &#x201c;He was quite, quite irresponsible,&#x201d; recalled Willie (later Viscount) Whitelaw, a fellow trainee officer at Pirbright. &#x201c;He just couldn&#x2019;t tolerate that we were being trained along the lines of the last major conflict. His reaction was just to ignore everything.&#x201d;<br><br> It was at the bar of White&#x2019;s, one of the most exclusive gentleman&#x2019;s clubs in London, that Stirling first learned about a form of soldiering that seemed much closer to the adventure and excitement he had in mind: a crack new commando unit intended to hit important enemy targets with maximum impact. Stirling&#x2019;s cousin, Lord Lovat, had been among the first to volunteer for the commandos.<br><br> Formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock, the force&#x2014;christened Layforce&#x2014;would consist of more than 1,500 volunteers formed into three commando regiments, recruited from the Foot Guards (the regular infantry of the Household Division) and other infantry regiments: an elite troop of specialized, highly trained raiders and marauders.

Both guilt and shame involve feeling "bad"-feeling bad about one's actions (or omissions) in the case of guilt; feeling bad about one's self in shame. The deep meaning of the word bad is "unable to fit": unable to fit into some external context in the case of guilt, unable to fit into one's own being in the case of shame. Human experience offers two different ways of discovering that one does not "fit," of feeling "bad." Each has to do with the boundaries of the human condition. But there are two kinds of boundaries, and it is important to recognize their difference, the difference between rules and goals. For though the human condition is bounded, recognizing that reality can be either a choking, tightening experience or it can lead to the discovery of a new freedom. True, shame's negative side points up failure and falling short, but shame also entails something positive: insight into the reality of the human condition. The experience of shame lays bare the essential paradox that inheres in being human: to be human is to be caught in a contradictory tension between the pull to the unlimited, the more-than-human, and the drag of the merely limited, the less-than-human. Shame's healing is to be found in the discovery of how that paradox can be lived creatively in ways that find other human beings to be not the problem in shame, but its solution.</p><p><b>Ernest Kurtz</b>, who completed his Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization at Harvard University in 1978, was the first researcher to be granted full access to the archives of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Chris Sedon snickered, and it kinda sounded like a Madagascar cockroach hiss since his nose had a bandage on it. Trisha Parks roach-hissed, too, even though she didn&#x2019;t have any bandages on her nose. Acting like a nasty insect was just natural to her, I guess.<br> <br>They hung together like that when they hassled me, Jerkface and his pet cockroaches, a matched set in their green gym shorts and shirts. You&#x2019;d think after everything that had happened, they&#x2019;d give this a rest, but noooooo. Same-old same-old.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t think Coach Gray heard them bothering me over all the noise from the skirmish group playing half-court behind us. Plus, she was busy hollering for YOU KIDS to KEEP IT DOWN since Coach Sedon, Chris&#x2019;s dad, was out getting surgery on his hand and she had to do EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY SO SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT!<br> <br>Four nicer kids from our class stood around the goal&#x2014;Krista Edmonds, Selena Ruiz, Mark Gopal, and Jake Siddiqi. Nobody but Selena looked at me, and when she did, Chris pointed at her. &#x201c;What do you want, fly-face?&#x201d; He put his fingers around his eyes, pretending he had thick glasses like hers. &#x201c;You think Messy here won&#x2019;t knock you in the nose if you tick her off?&#x201d;<br> <br>Selena made a rude gesture at him, and Mark pushed her hand down before Coach Gray saw it. I rubbed the sides of the basketball with both hands and looked at Selena, but she looked away.<br> <br>A little bit of sad squeezed tight in my throat. I tried to be nice like Krista and Selena and Mark and Jake, at least when people didn&#x2019;t make my brain itch. I mean, I hadn&#x2019;t even smacked anybody in this year&#x2019;s class, unlike Jerkface.<br> <br>Jake glanced in our direction and said, &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all are just a bunch of turkeys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Great.<br> <br>Did he mean Jerkface and the cockroaches, or me&#x2014;or all of us?<br> <br>&#x201c;Messy Jesse&#x2019;s a grody pig, not a turkey.&#x201d; Ryker pointed at my tangly hair as Chris and Trisha laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never gonna get any better at taking a shower, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Selena made another rude gesture, sort of at Ryker but maybe sort of at me, too, and she walked off with Krista and Jake and Mark following along behind. Coach Gray tweeted her whistle since they hadn&#x2019;t taken their shots on goal, but they acted like they didn&#x2019;t hear her.<br> <br>I positioned the ball and tried not to watch them leave. Jerkface and the cockroaches made some more noise, but I ignored them because Dad said ignoring cockroaches and keeping all the lights on was the best way to make them scurry away.<br> <br>&#x201c;See, Jesse-with-an-e?&#x201d; Jerkface mocked in my voice. &#x201c;Jesse-with-an-e, like boys spell it. Nobody likes you, Jesse-with-an-e.&#x201d;<br> <br>Did ignoring bugs ever really make them crawl off and bother somebody else? Because it had never worked for me. Breaking Ryker&#x2019;s nose with the basketball so it would match Chris&#x2019;s, now that would work for me, but when I turned in his direction, Coach Gray gave me a warning blast with her silver whistle.<br> <br>As if God agreed with her, it thundered outside.<br> <br>Coach gave me the look and shook her head.<br> <br>Not fair.<br> <br>Jerkfaces shouldn&#x2019;t be able to run their mouths if non-jerkfaces couldn&#x2019;t defend their tired ears. What was the problem with violence, anyway? It was effective. Bugs made such a satisfying crunch when you stomped on them.<br> <br>I glanced at the clock. I still had to put up with Jerkface and the cockroaches for seventeen minutes and thirty seconds. That wasn&#x2019;t much. Then again, it seemed like a lot. Tick-tock. I hadn&#x2019;t ever heard a clock make tick-tock noises. The clocks at AJS just made clicking sounds. Seventeen minutes. 1,020 more clicks. 1,019, 1,018, 1,017. . .<br> <br>I got a second blast from the whistle and Coach glared like she&#x2019;d come over to our group and make sure we regretted making her get up off her bottom-bleacher throne, so I forced myself to face the goal. Then I dug my purple fingernails into the sides of the basketball, squared my shoulders, lifted the ball to my chest, and powered it into the air.<br> <br>The ball fired off to the left like a broken rocket, almost beheaded Coach Gray, and smacked a bleacher step so hard it sounded like an explosion.<br> <br>Oops.<br> <br>As everybody ducked and covered, I fake-stumbled and ground my heel into Jerkface&#x2019;s toes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; he hollered, grabbing for his foot, but his cockroaches didn&#x2019;t hear him over the whoops of the skirmish group and the sudden hard rain on the gym roof.<br> <br>Ryker snarled and reached for me, but I dodged out of his way. Coach got up, caught the runaway basketball, and bounced it toward Ryker for his turn, all the while making her whistle screech at the top of its teeny metal lungs.<br> <br>Nine hundred clicks to go until I was Jerkface-and-cockroach-free for the day&#x2014;but at least I felt better enough to stop counting clicks.<br> <br>The cockroaches seemed to grasp that they had missed something as Ryker limped to his place at the foul line. They tried to jog toward him, but he waved them off and got ready to make his shot. Jerkface stood a lot straighter than I bothered to do, plus he was taller. His mom had played basketball in college and then gone pro and now she was on the city council, so Ryker thought he was something special every time he touched that ball. Really, all three of the cockroach crew thought they were something special, because everybody knew their parents. Plus, they had muscles and nice clothes and straight teeth and no zits and, of course, the newest phones.<br> <br>Ryker drew in a breath and managed to side-eye me in the process. I smiled at him, as fake-sweet as I could manage. His cheeks flushed crimson.<br> <br>Coach&#x2019;s whistle stabbed into my brain over and over again.<br> <br>Then a strange sound cut under the gym noises, and I thought somebody might be hurt and hollering. I made sure Ryker really was shooting that basketball and not coming after me, then checked the gym to see who had busted a knee.<br> <br>Everyone was standing or running except Springer Regal, the new kid who had been my new actual friend and fellow detective for a week. Springer hated all things athletic, and he had a note to sit out because he had gotten stomach flu last month, and he told me he planned to ride it for all it was worth. He was tucked in at the very top of the bleachers, resting against the wall with a book as thick as Dad&#x2019;s Shakespeare compendium, but he wasn&#x2019;t yelling or anything.<br> <br>The sound came again, a distant howl, like a pack of dogs or&#x2014;wait.<br> <br>Sirens?<br> <br>Everybody stopped running and yelling.<br> <br>Springer lifted his head, gazed in the direction of the noise, then looked at me, dread obvious in his wide brown eyes. He stood slowly, holding tight to his heavy book as another round of sirens wailed in the distance. The hairs along my arms and the back of my neck lifted, and despite the gym sweat dripping down the sides of my face, I shivered.<br> <br>Coach Gray&#x2019;s whistle punched deep into my mind, followed by her voice, higher-pitched than I&#x2019;d ever heard it before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hallway!&#x201d; she shrieked. &#x201c;Everyone!

Though this was only one regular season game, the match-up of these two teams demonstrated how Major League Baseball has changed since the early days of Athletics general manager Billy Beane and the publication of Michael Lewis&#x2019; classic book.</p><p>Over the past twenty years, power and analytics have taken over the game, driving carefully calibrated teams like the Astros to victory. Seemingly every pitcher now throws mid-90s heat and studiously compares their mechanics against the ideal. Every batter in the lineup can crack homers and knows their launch angles.

Though this was just one largely meaningless regular-season game, the matchup of these two teams demonstrated how Major League Baseball has changed since the early tenure of A&#x2019;s general manager Billy Beane and the publication of Michael Lewis&#x2019;s classic book.</p><p>Today, seemingly every pitcher throws mid-90-mph heat while seemingly every hitter is swinging for the fences. Today, pitchers and hitters alike can access reams of data and endless video in their relentless pursuits of perfection.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not just the players, either. Armed with information, management has adopted revolutionary strategies and tactics, from radical positioning of fielders to teams essentially giving up on whole seasons even <em>before</em> the season.</p><p>Does the shift work? What does throwing 100 miles an hour get you? Can you win with a homer-happy offense? Why would a baseball team need a supercomputer? Will umpires be replaced by robots? Why have home runs spiked lately? Have the baseballs been juiced, even as fewer players are juicing?</p><p>While chronicling each inning as these two franchises battle, Neyer considers these questions and many more, with the help of dozens of interviews with players, managers, scouts, and front-office executives.

At fifteen he received as a gift the memoirs of Sir John Franklin, a famous British explorer, which roused an immediate interest. This was increased further by Amundsen&#x2019;s compulsory military service, part of which consisted of roaming the rugged, snowy outdoors. Almost immediately after the end of his time in the army, further explorations deep in the Arctic circle beckoned.</p><p>At twenty-five, Amundsen was accepted into the Belgian Antarctic Expedition &#x2013; an event he considers very lucky. For it was here that he gained his first experiences of the Antarctic climate, and began to contemplate organizing a team to reach the South Pole. It was an epic journey; Amundsen&#x2019;s team, equipped with sleds run by dogs and clad in thick furs, famously became the first people ever to set foot on the South Pole.</p><p>Later in the book, Amundsen explains his efforts to chart the Northwest Passage in the remotest wildernesses of Canada. To this end, he made use of aircraft in the early 1920s. However, owing to the economic turmoil after World War One he found it difficult to finance his expeditions. Nevertheless, his spirit remained undaunted &#x2013; indeed, the tenacity that got Roald Amundsen so far shines in these pages.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Confessions of Young Nero</h2><p><b>Now in paperback, the newest novel from the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author, in which she turns her gaze on Emperor Nero, one of the most notorious and misunderstood figures in history.</b><br><br>Built on the backs of those who fell before it, Julius Caesar's imperial dynasty is only as strong as the next person who seeks to control it. No one is safe from the sting of betrayal: man, woman, or child.<br><br>While Nero idealizes the artistic and athletic principles of Greece, his very survival rests on his ability to navigate the sea of vipers that is Rome, including his own mother, a cold-blooded woman whose singular goal is to control the empire. But as Agrippina's machinations earn her son a title he is both tempted and terrified to assume, Nero's determination to escape her thrall will shape him into the Emperor he was fated to become.<br><br>Filled with impeccable research and captivating prose, <i>The Confessions of Young Nero</i> is the story of a boy's ruthless ascension to the throne and the lengths to which man will go in the ultimate quest for power and survival.</p><p><b>Margaret George</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eight novels of biographical historical fiction, including <i>The Splendor Before the Dark</i>; <i>The Confessions of Young Nero</i>;<i> Elizabeth I</i>; <i>Helen of Troy</i>; <i>Mary, Called Magdalene</i>; <i>The Memoirs of Cleopatra</i>;<i> Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles</i>; and<i> The Autobiography of Henry VIII</i>. She also has coauthored a children's book, <i>Lucille Lost</i>.I<br><br>Locusta<br><br>This is not the first time I have been imprisoned. So I am hopeful that this is a sham and that the new emperor, Galba, will soon need my unique services and quietly send for me and once again I shall be treading the palace halls. I feel at home there, and why shouldn't I? I have provided my timely services for those in power for many years.<br><br>By trade I am a poisoner. There, why not say it? And not any old poisoner, but the acknowledged expert and leader in my profession. So many others want to be another Locusta, another me. So I founded an academy to pass on my knowledge and train the next generation, for Rome will always be in need of poisoners. I should lament that, should say what a pity that Rome must descend to that, but that would be hypocritical of me. Besides, I am not convinced that poison is not the best way to die. Think of all the other ways a person may die at the hands of Rome: being torn by beasts in the arena, being strangled in the Tullianum prison, and, most insipid of all, being ordered to open your veins and bleed yourself to death, like a sacrificial animal. Bah. Give me a good poison anytime. Did not Cleopatra embrace the asp and its poison, leaving her beautiful and stretched out upon her couch?<br><br>I first met the late emperor Nero when he was still a child, still Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, the name he was born with. I saw him at the low point in his life, when he was an abandoned child at the mercy of his uncle Caligula. (Now, that was someone who gave me a lively string of business!) His father was dead, his mother, Agrippina, had been banished when he was not even three years old, and his uncle liked to toy with him.<br><br>I remember he was a likable child-well, he remained likable all his life; it was a gift-but timorous. Many things frightened him, especially loud noises and being sent for unexpectedly. Caligula had a habit of that-sending for people in the middle of the night. He once forced me to watch a nocturnal theatrical performance in the palace, featuring himself as Jupiter. Sometimes it was harmless, like the playacting; other times it ended with the death of the helpless person he had sent for. So, Nero-let us call him that to avoid confusion, just as I call Caligula Caligula rather than Gaius Caesar Germanicus-was precocious in recognizing the danger of the serpent in his uncle.<br><br>Ah, such memories! Here in my cell I find myself returning to them, helping the hours to pass, until that moment when Galba sends for me with a task. I know he will!<br><br>II<br><br>Nero<br><br>The moon was round and full. It shone on the flat surface of the lake, which was also round, making it appear that the moon itself had expanded and enlarged itself there. It rose golden from the encircling hills but soon was a bright white ball high above.<br><br>It illuminated the wide deck of the ship. I was to sit beside my uncle and listen to him intoning praise to the goddess Diana, whose sanctuary was on the shore of the lake and to whom the lake itself was sacred.<br><br>I remember the flame of the torches that threw a flickering red light on the faces around me, in contrast to the clear bluish-white moonlight bathing the wider scene. My uncle's face looked not like a human's but like a demon's, with a burning hue.<br><br>These are all impressions, memories that swirl without being attached to anything. The reflection on the water-the torches-the thin, reedy voice of my uncle-the nervous laughter around me-the chill in the air-<br><br>I was only three years old, so it is no wonder my memories are disconnected.<br><br>Then his face shoved up into mine, his silky voice saying, "What shall I do with the bitch's whelp?"<br><br>More nervous laughter. His rough hands grabbed my shoulders and hauled me up, my legs dangling helplessly.<br><br>"I shall sacrifice him to the goddess!" He strode over to the rail and held me over the rippling water. I can still see the undulation of the reflected moonlight, waiting for me. "She wants a human sacrifice, and what more worthy than this kin of mine, descendant of the divine Augustus? Only the best for Diana, and perhaps a propitiation for the lapse of Augustus, who preferred to worship her brother Apollo. There you go!"<br><br>And I was flung out over the water, landing with a splash, cold, cold, and I sank, unable to swim or even cry out. Then strong hands grasped me, pulled me mercifully out of the water, and I could breathe. I was hauled onto the deck, where my uncle stood, hands on hips, laughing.<br><br>"Better luck next time, eh, Chaerea? You are too softhearted, to rescue such flotsam. Anything born of my sister can come to no good."<br><br>III<br><br>As I sat shivering next to Chaerea I could see down the whole length of the huge boat, see the light dancing on the mosaic-covered deck, the moonlight shining on the white marble cabin. The madman who had thrown me in the water now paced up and down, laughing. Not until I was older did I hear such a laugh again, and it was from a captive hyena, whining and mewling in its cage.<br><br>Let me off, let me off, let me off this boat, I prayed, to what god I knew not, just whatever god was listening.<br><br>"Come, lad," said Chaerea, putting his huge arm around my shoulders. "You should walk, warm up." He pulled me up and marched me up and down the deck, until feeling returned to my numb feet. We passed the rowers, whose heads turned as if on stalks to see us as we passed. One or two smiled. The others looked like the statues that were placed here and there on the deck.<br><br>"The shore is close," said Chaerea, holding me up and pointing to it. "Soon we will be back on it."<br><br>How I got back and when I got back I do not know. I have told you, my memories are wispy from this early age and do not join together to make a whole; rather, they are like pieces of cloud drifting through the sky of my mind, each portion separate and contained. But the horrible memory of the boat ride is burned into my mind.<br><br>My little bed in my aunt�s home, where I lived, was narrow and hard; I can feel the rough linen when I think about it, but cannot see what else is in the room. I know the place was in the country because I heard roosters crow in the morning and I remember gathering eggs, still warm, from a bed of straw. I also remember many kinds of butterflies, and flowers on tall stalks, although I know now those were weeds.<br><br>I called my aunt Butterfly because one of her names was Lepida, which means elegant and graceful, and she was very pretty. Her hair was the reddish color of copper with a bit of dust on it, not the bright shiny copper that has just been polished. She was my father's younger sister and told me stories about him-he who had died before I could know him-and about their ancestors. When I told her how the sun made her hair glow, she laughed and said, "Bronze hair is in our family. I can see little glints of it in yours, too, even though it's mainly blond. Shall I tell you the story about how it came to be that color?"<br><br>"Oh, yes!" I settled in next to her, hoping it would be a long story.<br><br>"Well, long ago one of our ancestors saw two tall and handsome young men standing in the road."<br><br>"Were they gods?" I guessed. Whenever tall strangers appeared out of nowhere, they were gods.<br><br>"Indeed they were-the twin gods Castor and Pollux. They told our ancestor that the Romans had won a great battle, and to go to Rome and tell everyone. To prove that they were gods and telling the truth, they reached out and touched his beard, and it turned instantly from black to red. So from then on the family was called Ahenobarbus-Bronze Beard."<br><br>"Did my father have a red beard?" I wanted to know more about him. I wanted to hear that he was a hero and famous and that his death had been tragic. I later found out he was none of the above.<br><br>"Oh, yes. He was a true Ahenobarbus. Another unusual thing about our family is that all the men have only two personal names-Lucius and Gnaeus. Your father was a Gnaeus and you are a Lucius. Your grandfather, also a Lucius, was a consul but also a chariot racer. A famous one, too."<br><br>I had little ivory play chariots, and I loved racing them against one another on the floor. "When can I drive a chariot?"<br><br>Aunt Butterfly cocked her head, smiling. "Not for a while yet. You have to be very strong to race chariots. The horses pull the reins from your hands unless you hold very tight, and the chariot bounces and you have to be careful not to fall out, which is very dangerous."<br><br>"Maybe I could have a little chariot, pulled by ponies?"<br><br>"Perhaps," she said. "But you are still too young even for that."<br><br>I do remember this conversation about the chariots and the red beards. But why I was living with Aunt Butterfly, and what had happened to my mother and father, I still did not know. I knew my father was dead, but I did not know about my mother. All I knew was that she was not there.<br><br>Aunt gave me two teachers. One was named Paris and he was an actor and a dancer. The other was named Castor and he was a barber. He shaved the beard of Aunt�s husband (who did not have a bronze beard but a regular brown one) and sewed up cuts and did other handy things. Paris was only for fun. I could not see that he did anything but act and pretend to be someone else. First he would tell a story-usually it was about a Greek, because they seemed to have the best stories-and then he would pretend to be those people. In real life, he was dark and not very tall. But when he played Apollo, I swear he grew tall before my eyes and his hair lightened.<br><br>"No, little one," he would say, laughing. "That is only your imagination. It is the actor's job to make you see and hear things inside your own head."<br><br>"Does an actor do magic?"<br><br>He glanced around; a frightened look flitted over his eyes. "Of course not! The magic happens only in your own thoughts."<br><br>It was not long before I learned that practicing magic was forbidden, and that there was just such practice going on in that household.<br><br>In some ways it was odd to be the only child in the household. I did not have anyone to play with except Paris-who was childlike in many ways but still an adult-and the children who were slaves. Aunt did not like my playing with them but she could not be watching all the time, and what did she expect me to do? Let me say it: I was lonely. Lonely as in alone, as in solitary, as in set apart. Aunt kept stressing that being set apart was a special thing, a glorious thing, but it only felt like a punishment to me. So I found freedom in playing with the slave children my own age, and freedom in acting out the parts Paris taught me. Sometimes I was a god; sometimes I was a girl (I would be Persephone to his Hades-and we always used the proper Greek names, not the Roman ones of Proserpine and Pluto); sometimes I was an adult. On the stage-in actuality just the courtyard-I could be anyone. In real life, as Aunt kept reminding me, I was the descendant of the divine Augustus and must remember this at all times. But, as Paris informed me, I was also the descendant of his adversary Marc Antony, and Marc Antony was a lot more fun than the stolid and dull divine Augustus.<br><br>"Antony went to the east, to the lands that speak Greek, and to Egypt, and reveled in music, flowers, wine, and the Mysteries of Dionysus. He commanded a great fleet of ships and had a wife named Cleopatra, queen of Egypt. He-"<br><br>"Ruined himself, and disgraced himself as a Roman," cut in a sharp voice. We turned to see Aunt's husband, Silanus, standing in the doorway. It was doubly frightening because he was rarely at home. He stepped over to me, bent down, and looked me in the eyes. "Let Paris tell you the whole story, then. Go on, Paris!" He jerked his head up toward the trembling tutor.<br><br>"Uhh . . . he fought a great sea battle against Augustus, at Actium, and he lost."<br><br>"More than that, he fled back to Egypt, rather than falling on his sword as any self-respecting Roman general should do," finished Silanus. "Before he had defected to the east, he had married Augustus's sister. He left two fine daughters behind, Antonia the Elder and Antonia the Younger. You are descended from both of them. Never forget you are the heir of the Roman Marc Antony, not the debauched and debased Greek one."<br><br>He was so fierce about it I nodded just to get him to look away. Finally he did, standing up and telling Paris to get back to his regular lessons with me, and none of that Greek nonsense.<br><br>After he was safely gone, I said, "But what happened to Marc Antony back in Egypt?"<br><br>"Augustus pursued him there and he died. He is buried in Egypt, not in Rome. Now, Egypt is a very interesting place-there are ancient ruins and huge pyramids-many tombs-and all in all, not a bad place to lie for eternity." He whispered to me, "Antony had other children in Egypt; Augustus brought them back here and raised them as Romans."<br><br>"Did it work? Were they good Romans?"<br><br>"As far as anyone could tell. The girl grew up to be queen of Mauretania, and her son came to Rome later. He would have been your cousin."<br><br>"What happened to him?"<br><br>"Caligula had him executed-because he dared to wear royal purple in the emperor's presence. Now do you see how lucky you were that he only threw you overboard? And that he let someone rescue you? And only laughed about it?"</p><h2>Mind to Mind (Studies in Consciousness)</h2><p><p><i>Telepathy includes the communication of emotions, ideas, mental images, sensations or words from one individual to another without the help of the senses...</i></p><p>In the early part of the twentieth century, a chemical engineer named Rene Warcollier devised and conducted a series of experiments in telepathic communication.

Fleeing from Beirut in search of solace, Zahra stays with her uncle in West Africa&#x2014;and then uses marriage as another kind of escape.

A carefully woven assemblage of legends, aphorisms, fairy tales and nihilistic philosophy, it remains a deeply enigmatic and haunting work more than a century later, a gathering of literary and personal ruins written in a style that evokes both the Brothers Grimm and Friedrich Nietzsche. <i>The Book of Monelle</i> was the result of Schwob&#x2019;s intense emotional suffering over the loss of his love, a &#x201c;girl of the streets&#x201d; named Louise, whom he had befriended in 1891 and who succumbed to tuberculosis two years later. Transforming her into the innocent prophet of destruction, Monelle, Schwob tells the stories of her various sisters: girls succumbing to disillusionment, caught between the misleading world of childlike fantasy and the bitter world of reality. This new translation reintroduces a true fin-de-si�cle masterpiece into English.<br><br>A secret influence on generations of writers, from Guillaume Apollinaire and Jorge Luis Borges to Roberto Bola�o, <b>Marcel Schwob</b> (1867&#x2013;1905) was as versed in the street slang of medieval thieves as he was in the poetry of Walt Whitman (whom he translated into French). Paul Val�ry and Alfred Jarry both dedicated their first books to him, and he was the uncle of Surrealist photographer Claude Cahun.</p><p></p><h2>Scheherazade Goes West: Different Cultures, Different Harems</h2><p>Fatema Mernissi, the world-renowned Islamic feminist, has shed unprecedented light on the lives of women in the Middle East, in works hailed as "enchanting" <i>(The New York Times Book Review),</i> "exuberant" <i>(Elle),</i> and "remarkable" <i>(The Washington Post Book World).</i> Now, in <i>Scheherazade Goes West,</i> Mernissi reveals her unique experiences as a liberated, independent Moroccan woman faced with the peculiarities and unexpected encroachments of Western culture. Her often surprising discoveries about the conditions of and attitudes toward women around the world -- and the exquisitely embroidered amalgam of clear-eyed autobiography and dazzling meta-fiction by which she relates those assorted discoveries -- add up to a deliciously wry, engagingly cosmopolitan, and deeply penetrating narrative.</p><p>Fatima Mernissi's unclassifiable book, at turns scholarly, playful, watchful, and admonitory, perfectly juxtaposes the relations between men and women in Europe with those in the Muslim world. In <i>Scheherazade Goes West: Different Cultures, Different Harems</i>, there is a studied casualness in Mernissi's observations, which she presents as a series of discoveries reached through conversations with friends, through reading and travels, and through her own lived experience as a liberated Moroccan woman, a feminist professor of sociology at a Moroccan university. In 1994, Mernissi traveled to 10 Western cities to promote her bestselling book, <i>Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood</i>, a luxury not available to her illiterate grandmother Yasmina, to whom the harem was a prison, rather than the idealized sanctuary of Western myth. <p> The contrasts Mernissi discovered between East and West were not as simple as one might imagine. In Berlin, for example, she leafed through pornographic German photo books of "harem women," produced for an eager audience of Western men, and in Paris, she accompanied a male friend on a walking tour of his favorite odalisques, from Ingres to Matisse, while he explained how comforting an insecure man found these nude, silent women. While the medieval caliphs tended to prize intelligence and erudition among the women of their harems, Western writers have lauded beauty over every other quality; as Kant put it, a learned woman "might as well even have a beard." In deceptively light prose, Mernissi introduces the sexual politics of Islam to a Western audience, while pointing out the inconsistencies and illogic in the Western tradition. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><b>Fatema Mernissi</b> is a professor of sociology at the University of Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco.

As the friendly competition intensified on the steep dirt trail they called Repack, history's first mountain bikers began craving an upgrade from the old Schwinn cruisers they had rescued from the junkyard. With the single-minded focus found only among the truly obsessed, this rag-tag group sparked a rapid evolution that transformed the castoff Repack bomber into the modern mountain bike, a refined and elegant machine that quickly became the top-selling bicycle in the world.</p><p>Charlie Kelly -- co-founder of the MountainBikes company with Gary Fisher, organizer of the Repack races, and chronicler of the sport -- now delivers the true, complete, and often unbelievable history of the rise of mountain biking and its lasting culture. Rich with first-hand descriptions and bursting with original photographs, drawings, and memorabilia, <i>Fat Tire Flyer</i> is the definitive history of one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century. </p></p><p><p><b>THE TRUE, COMPLETE, AND EXTRAORDINARY TALE OF THE INVENTION OF REPACK AND THE RISE OF MOUNTAIN BIKING</b></p><p> "It's a cool, clear morning in Northern California, but the five young men are sweating profusely as they push strangely modified bicycles up the steep hill. They are discussing the dirt road surface, which re �sembles a moonscape more than it does a road. </p><p>"These young men belong to the same breed that skis down cliffs, jumps out of airplanes, or rides skate �boards down Everest.

We itch, sneeze, suffer from joint pain, inflammation, sleep disorders, irritability, anxiety, bowel disease, diarrhea, flatulence, stomach pain, heartburn and acid reflux, nausea, bloating and other digestive problems, eczema, psoriasis, tissue swelling, urticaria (hives), itching skin, itching scalp, sinusitis, runny nose, puffy eyes, hay fever, asthma, and breathing difficulties, or endure tension headaches, migraines, fuzzy thinking, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, painful periods (women), sudden drops in blood pressure, faintness or flushing. Symptoms may endure throughout our entire lives if we continue to consume large amounts of histamine without knowing it. Histamine is colorless, odorless and tasteless - undetectable except by scientific analysis, and yet crucial to our well-being. Individual histamine tolerance thresholds vary greatly. A range of circumstances including our genes, our environment, our diet and stress, cause our bodies&#x2019; histamine levels to rise. If they rise faster than our bodies can break them down, we experience the excessive inflammation brought on by histamine intolerance, or HIT. The good news is, if we can understand what is happening and why, we can treat or prevent this widely unrecognized condition. By far the best way to treat histamine intolerance is with diet. All foods with the potential to raise histamine levels should be avoided until your health improves significantly. This book discusses HIT in depth, including causes, symptoms and therapies, backed by scientific research. Along with a list of foods to help HIT sufferers, it includes a wide range of recipes for everything from entr�es to desserts. The front cover shows the revised date of 2017.

A university graduate with a diploma of education, Gibb became interested in the relationship between nutrition and health when a family member was diagnosed with a chronic disease. He spent many years investigating natural alternatives to the powerful drugs prescribed for this condition, whose side effects can be damaging and debilitating. Over time he accumulated a wealth of information, which culminated in the writing of this book. &#39;Medical science has made enormous leaps in the 21st century,&#39; writes Gibb, &#39;and without it, we would all be worse off. Dedicated medical researchers and doctors have improved our quality of life far beyond the standards available to preceding generations. That said, it is sometimes the afflicted themselves, or those closest to them, who are motivated to persevere just that little bit more keenly in pursuit of answers. Often, people with a personal investment in a health problem will stop at nothing to find a solution, seeking far and wide, never giving up. &#39;One example is the relentless quest of Augusto and Michaela Odone to find a treatment for their son Lorenzo&#39;s adrenoleukodystrophy, in the face of skepticism from health professionals. Their experience was later dramatized in the movie &#39;Lorenzo&#39;s Oil&#39;. &#39;Another example is provided by Elaine Gottschall, whose daughter was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis. Medications failed to improve the child&#39;s condition, and most doctors dismissed the idea that diet could be in any way associated with this digestive disease. It was a maverick doctor who thought &#39;outside the box&#39; who finally led Ms Gottschall to a treatment for her daughter. When he died, to preserve his knowledge she wrote a book called &#39;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&#39;, which has been translated into several languages, and is published worldwide.&#39; &#39;My own experience with a suffering child motivated me to search for answers even in the most unlikely places, which conventional medicine may overlook. Accepted medical opinion is far from infallible, as has been demonstrated from time to time, notably when Dr Barry Marshall swallowed Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria to test the theory that they were a cause of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The H. pylori theory was ridiculed by scientists and doctors of the &#39;establishment&#39;, who did not believe any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach. Marshall has been quoted as saying in 1998 that &#34;(e)veryone was against me, but I knew I was right.&#34; &#39;Sometimes it takes an outsider, unblinkered by conventional training, to perceive a truth. ( After all, it was a humble clerk in the Swiss Patents Office who became the father of modern physics.) &#39;When the Strictly Low Histamine Diet had an almost miraculous effect on my own, seemingly unrelated symptoms I, too felt driven to share this knowledge with others.&#39; James L Gibb, March 2014<p>"In this book, [Gibb] shows the results of a wide-ranging investigation of the relationship between nutrition and health, suggesting that HIT intolerance may contribute to conditions as disparate as allergies, bowel disease, eczema, heartburn, stomach pain, joint pain, anxiety, psoriasis and sleep disorders, among others. ... His innovative approach is bolstered by careful, thoughtful investigation, and motivated by an urge to help others. ... Practical, valuable information that offers a measure of hope for those suffering from a chronic physical condition." - Kirkus Reviews</p></p><h2>MS. MARVEL VOL. 3</h2><p>Earth's Mightiest Metamorph!

He now lectures widely on the subject, to audiences ranging from Ivy League students to NASA scientists to Southwest Airlines executives, and runs the language blog figarospeech.com.1<br><br>PRACTICE WITCRAFT<br><br>The Square Root of Rainbows Formulas for Memorability<br><br>My first real lesson in what I call &#x201c;witcraft&#x201d; came off a loading dock in Philadelphia. I was sixteen and just starting my first summer job at a department store. My assigned mentor, Al, was a man of the world at least two years my senior. He led me onto a semitrailer and pulled a thousand-dollar dress from a hanging rack.<br><br>&#x201c;Observe.&#x201d;<br><br>Al ripped the fabric down the middle, recorded the dress as damaged, and turned significantly to me. &#x201c;With responsibility,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;comes great power.&#x201d;<br><br>I had heard the old chestnut about power and responsibility, but it had never occurred to me that a cliche could be corrupted so deliciously. From that day on, I hung on to everything the guy said.<br><br>In retrospect, he wasn&#x2019;t all that witty, and his bon mot certainly wasn&#x2019;t worth a designer gown. Needless to say, Al proved to be a dubious moral guide; next day he taught me how to surf the roof of a moving delivery van. But that summer he became my first living Word Hero.<br><br>In the years since, I&#x2019;ve studied witcraft as an effective way to change people&#x2019;s emotions, their minds, and their willingness to act. I learned how to get people&#x2019;s attention and make a good impression, even better than the one Al made on me. I wrote a book, Thank You for Arguing, and went on to coach rhetoric, the art of persuasion, with students, lawyers, corporate execs, and aerospace engineers. I read all the ancient and modern rhetorical wisdom I could find and have employed the advice and help of hundreds of experts.<br><br>But Al was the first to teach me the essence of word heroism: with a very little wit comes great power.<br>THE SHAPE AND FORM OF HEROISM<br><br>Since then I&#x2019;ve had some terrific mentors. The great Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero--lowborn, stubby, turnip-nosed Cicero--stood on words and led the Roman republic. He and other rhetoricians through history, from Joan of Arc to Barack Obama, grasped the secrets of image crafting through witcraft. They set their words in stone, sometimes literally. They were Word Heroes. I&#x2019;d like to help make you, too, into a Word Hero; maybe not on the order of a Shakespeare or Churchill, but someone who holds a share of immortality.<br><br>Word heroism takes very few words--no more than a dozen or so. Few of us remember Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s speeches, but many of us remember the memorable, the characteristic parts, that made FDR FDR. &#x201c;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#x201d; &#x201c;This is a day that will live in infamy.&#x201d;<br><br>To create memorable words yourself, you simply need to discover a set of techniques,--forty-three in all--that have been used by masters from Winston Churchill to Jimmy Kimmel. These tools will help you focus on the few words that count the most in a conversation, argument, important e-mail, blog post, thank-you letter, college paper, or presentation.<br><br>This book does far more than merely list the techniques, though. Consider it a course in self-taught heroism, and use it to develop your own unforgettability. From the next chapter on, you will progress through the stages of phrase-making mastery, beginning with Word Apprentice and working up to Word Hero, that rarified state where your witcraft compels people to remember your name. By the time you achieve word heroism, you will have gained:<br><br>* Confidence in your ability to write and speak<br><br>* Knowledge of what makes a memorable expression memorable<br><br>* Prowess in producing the right words in just the right order for maximum effect<br><br>* Skill in the techniques used (consciously or instinctively) by the most unforgettable personalities in history and pop culture<br><br>You&#x2019;ll project a strong, articulate personality, the kind people like and respect. But we&#x2019;re talking about more than image polishing. We&#x2019;re talking about a lasting image, one that lingers after you leave the room--or this mortal coil, for that matter. The right words, arranged perfectly, leave a lasting impression in an audience&#x2019;s brain. And what are the techniques to create this magic? Figures of speech.<br><br>Word sounds and rhythms, puns and wordplay qualify as figures--the term rhetoricians give words in unusual context or order.<br><br>You know the expression &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just a figure of speech.&#x201d; Personally, I object to the &#x201c;just.&#x201d; Figures can do for speech what architectural forms do for a cityscape, or the female human form does to your average randy male. A figure in the physical world composes the shape or form of something; look at the Washington Monument on a foggy day and you&#x2019;ll make out the figure of a column. Less monumentally, we traditionally call a woman&#x2019;s shape or form her figure. A figure of speech works the same way, usually without the obsession over phallic architecture and weight loss. This rhetorical figure constitutes the shape or form of words in a sentence.<br><br>Figures get an audience&#x2019;s attention because they stand out from the rest of language. Take this head-snapping hyperbole from the TV show Glee:<br><br>Sue: You have enough product in your hair to season a wok.<br><br>An unexpected ending to an ordinary line (again, in Glee) can get an audience&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>Kurt: He&#x2019;s cheating off a girl who thinks the square root of four is rainbows.<br><br>You can raise eyebrows by ironically agreeing with your interlocutor.<br><br>Will: Who&#x2019;s to say everything I do is one hundred percent on the ball?<br><br>Sue: No one would say that.<br><br>It&#x2019;s all about delivering the unexpected. The audience unconsciously hyperfocuses on your words and makes its own links to the familiar. The effort makes them more than passive listeners. They become active participants in your words. (If you&#x2019;re witty enough, you hear this participation in the form of laughter.) The links the brain makes between the familiar and the less familiar take place in electrochemical connections called synapses. Imagine if you ran into Angelina Jolie on an elevator. Even if you had never met her before, your brain has linked up enough synapses that you would have no trouble recognizing her. Stranger who doesn&#x2019;t know me, the brain says, while the synapses fire like crazy: Movies. Dark-haired women. Fat lips. Hollywood beauties. Eighty-seven adopted kids. Brangelina. And so on. What got your attention in the first place was the shock of seeing this familiar-looking woman. Your brain did the rest. Memorability comes in part from linking the familiar (Angelina!) with the unfamiliar (Hollywood star in my elevator!). The utterly familiar, on the other hand (same creepy guy you see every day, inspection sticker), gets ignored.<br><br>You know how camouflage works, using patterns and colors to fade into the background. Similarly, a good spy looks perfectly ordinary and speaks in perfectly ordinary ways. To rouse someone&#x2019;s awareness, you do the opposite: go for the unusual and unexpected. Later on, you&#x2019;ll see figures that help you sneak up on an audience and give it a rhetorical knock on the head. The more surprising figures mug the audience&#x2019;s expectations, twist grammar or logic, or marry unlike things. You can use them to look witty, tell a memorable story, get a laugh, or change the emotions in the room. But all figures deliver something out of the ordinary. Every good figure is an attention-getting figure.<br><br>I selected the best figures for the tools in this book. The easiest and most fun part of rhetoric, figures compose the core of my language blog, Figarospeech.com, where I take on the guise of Figaro (last name &#x201c;Speech&#x201d;), a committed, even obsessive, &#x201c;figurist,&#x201d; or coiner of figures. Figaro explores the tricks and pratfalls of language in politics and the media. Owing to our national ignorance of rhetoric, I tend to find more pratfalls than tricks. But knowing your figures can turn you from someone of the pratfall variety into a skilled practitioner of the art. With the right tools, you will gain the ability to compose beautiful prose, express irrefutable anger, proclaim your love, get people on your side, or thank them as they have never been thanked.<br><br>Figures can do all that. The Greeks believed in them so much that the philosopher Plato actually wanted to ban them. If Plato had had his way, Athens might have had a figure czar just as we have a drug czar. He had a point. Figures in the wrong hands can be powerful forces for evil as well as for good. In fact, your ability to spot their use will let you see through the tricks of marketers and politicians.<br><br>In your own hands, well, make sure you act the hero.<br><br>A warning: too much of this good thing--this witcraft and clever wording--can become an embarrassment of riches, overwhelming your audience or turning it off. Not even Churchill and MLK came up with a blockbuster in every sentence. Their audiences&#x2019; heads would have exploded. Use the tools in the book for a few great memorable words, and then build your other, simpler words around them.<br>WORD IT LIKE WARREN<br><br>In fact, born Word Heroes use figures instinctively without sounding overly ornate. Take Warren Buffett. Investors read his annual Berkshire Hathaway chairman&#x2019;s letter as if it came from the oracle of Delphi. They savor his wit while they glean the secrets of the world&#x2019;s savviest investor. OK, they read mostly for the investment secrets; but how many investment letters get quoted for decades afterward? Warren Buffett&#x2019;s do, because he proves himself to be a wizard at figures, the rhetorical as well as the business kind.<br><br>For instance, Buffett clearly likes one of my own favorite devices: taking cliches literally. Look at this quote from a panel discussion he did in 2008:<br><br>Buffett: I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.<br><br>See what he did? He took the cliche &#x201c;an idiot can run it&#x201d; and imagined it wasn&#x2019;t a cliche at all. Why prefer something that an idiot can run, if an idiot will never run it?<br><br>Buffett even instinctively knows the figure that defines terms to get the upper hand in an argument.<br><br>Buffett: Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.<br><br>The quote reminds me of the late, lamented cartoon &#x201c;Shoe.&#x201d; In one strip the son asks his journalist dad, &#x201c;Why are you staring out the window? You should be typing.&#x201d; Dad answers, &#x201c;Typists type. Writers stare out windows.&#x201d; This device, which chapter 8 covers, lets you redefine an issue in one short expression.<br><br>If you really want to achieve immortality, though, talk like Yogi Berra, the immortal logic buster who said, &#x201c;If you find a fork in the road, take it,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Nobody goes there anymore. It&#x2019;s too crowded.&#x201d; When you abandon logic to achieve a higher wisdom, you coin a figure called a Yogism (chapter 12). Warren Buffett is good at this, too.<br><br>Buffett: Occasionally, a man must rise above principles.<br><br>You have to love a wit like that--and people do. Easy for Warren to say, right? Well, speaking figuratively does take practice. It also takes a bit of studying. I make the studying part easier with a method for examining memorable words. Called unwriting, it works like this: to see how a quote you like varies from plain ordinary speech, write it as you or I would normally say it, without the wit. You&#x2019;ll learn this technique in chapter 3.<br><br>To get the general idea of unwriting, grab this Buffett quote:<br><br>Buffett: Beware of geeks bearing formulas.<br><br>Next, put it in plain, unmemorable language:<br><br>Unwritten: You should be skeptical of number crunchers and their computer models.<br><br>Now ask yourself how Buffett&#x2019;s quote varies from the unwritten version. As he often does, he twisted a cliche--&#x201c;Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.&#x201d; The old saying probably occurred to him when he was thinking of computer geeks. Hmmm. Beware of geeks . . . Beware of geeks bearing . . . um, formulas! All you have to do to complete the picture is to become an investment wizard and make more money than anybody in the world. Personally, I still find mutual funds a mystery. But you have to start somewhere. Besides, while Word Heroes like Buffett are to the mannerisms born, the rest of us must be made. We have to learn the tools.<br>NAMING THE TOOLS<br><br>In ancient Rome, students learned their figures after they learned grammar, considering them to be the next step in training the sophisticated mind. While schools still teach some grammar, modern education tends to stop at that point. It&#x2019;s as if our education ground to a halt in the sixth grade, as if our society limited mathematics to arithmetic and ignored the calculus and finite math behind our bridges and computers. An education in figurative language actually helps you move beyond grammar. Some people--the kind who see grammar as the equivalent of the laws of Moses--need to get used to some figures. Logic lovers may not like the more fallacious aspects of figures either. But as you shall see, there are good, persuasive reasons to bend the rules.<br><br>The same urge that drives some of us to know the rules also makes us want to learn the names for the tools. It certainly helps to know the difference between an adjective and an adverb, and a pronoun&#x2019;s missing antecedent can be difficult to spot when you don&#x2019;t know your antecedent from your elbow. For similar reasons, you will find names for the figurative tools in this book, in the chapters that describe them as well as in an appended glossary. Not only can the terms help you remember the techniques themselves, but they also help prove that I have some serious scholarly backup--that the figures did not spring newborn out of my head.<br><br>The problem is, most of the official terms for these techniques happen to come in the form of unpronounceable ancient Greek. Take, for instance, this old joke:<br><br>You said you wanted to play football in the worst way. Well, you&#x2019;re playing it in the worst way.<br><br>The joke uses a remarkably useful device that repeats words while changing their meaning. The figure has an official name, antistasis (an-TIH-sta-sis), but in the text I call it the repeat changer. If you once happened to be the kind of curious child who memorized the names of dinosaurs, rest assured that you will find the official name wherever one exists. For those of us who find the tools more important than the names, my informal labels should make the tools easier to remember. After all, it&#x2019;s what the tools do that counts.</p><h2>Afro-Dog: Blackness and the Animal Question</h2><p>The animal-rights organization PETA asked &#x201c;Are Animals the New Slaves?&#x201d; in a controversial 2005 fundraising campaign; that same year, after the Humane Society rescued pets in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina while black residents were neglected, some declared that white America cares more about pets than black people. These are but two recent examples of a centuries-long history in which black life has been pitted against animal life. Does comparing human and animal suffering trivialize black pain, or might the intersections of racialization and animalization shed light on interlinked forms of oppression?<br><br>In <i>Afro-Dog</i>, B�n�dicte Boisseron investigates the relationship between race and the animal in the history and culture of the Americas and the black Atlantic, exposing a hegemonic system that compulsively links and opposes blackness and animality to measure the value of life. She analyzes the association between black civil disobedience and canine repression, a history that spans the era of slavery through the use of police dogs against protesters during the civil rights movement of the 1960s to today in places like Ferguson, Missouri. She also traces the lineage of blackness and the animal in Caribbean literature and struggles over minorities&#x2019; right to pet ownership alongside nuanced readings of Derrida and other French theorists. Drawing on recent debates on black lives and animal welfare, <i>Afro-Dog</i> reframes the fast-growing interest in human&#x2013;animal relationships by positioning blackness as a focus of animal inquiry, opening new possibilities for animal studies and black studies to think side by side.</p><p>B�n�dicte Boisseron is associate professor of Afroamerican and African studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She is the author of <i>Creole Renegades: Rhetoric of Betrayal and Guilt in the Caribbean Diaspora</i> (2014).Dazzling in its reach and groundbreaking in its methodology, <i>Afro-Dog</i> redraws the contours of intellectual inquiry with dogs at the lead. Boisseron aims to rethink the hyper-legality of racism and the practice of inequality in ways that are radical and far-reaching. (Colin Dayan, author of <i>With Dogs at the Edge of Life</i>)<br><br>B�n�dicte Boisseron&#x2019;s <i>Afro-Dog</i> hones in, acutely and in detail, on the often-unhappy convergence of 'animal' and 'black' in current and historical thought, deftly dismantling their rhetorical obfuscations while sacrificing neither 'the animal' nor 'the black.' Instead, she calls for attending to human-animal encounters through the lens of black and animal defiance, a kind of subversive interspecies alliance that could empower both. Brilliantly enlisting theoretical and critical voices in critical race studies, animal studies, Afropessimism, ecofeminism, and more, Boisseron brings a crucial Black Alantic and diasporic perspective to bear on blackness and the question of the animal to show, <i>not </i>that blackness and animality are comparable, but that black people and animals have been and are historically and concretely connected&#x2015;most often in the form of 'man' and 'dog.' (Carla Freccero, University of California, Santa Cruz)<br><br>In <i>Afro-Dog</i>,<i> </i>Boisseron brilliantly demonstrates how the relationship between race and personhood has been missing entirely from the current human/animal rights debate, resulting in the argument that animals constitute the new 'slaves.' In doing so she offers a long overdue exploration of the larger and more extended links in American and French culture where blackness and animality have become almost interchangeable in popular discourse. (Sandra Gunning, University of Michigan)<br><br><i>Afro-Dog</i> is a timely effort to tackle the fraught relations between posthumanism and postcolonialism and between animal studies and African American studies. Inflected by continental philosophy, Boisseron&#x2019;s readings follow a historical trail of dogs from the Middle Passage to the Ferguson unrest in order to theorize a legacy of connections between racism and speciesism, but without posing a false analogy between the two. Especially insightful and important are her arguments about the potential dangers of intersectional analyses which 'risk reproducing what they mean to reject.' (Kari Weil, author of <i>Thinking Animals: Why Animal Studies Now?</i>)<br><br><i>Afro-Dog</i> is an amazing book! The animal is not 'the new black'; animals are not the new slaves; and animal studies is not heir to the postcolonial turn. Instead, racialization, specifically New World blackness, is now present in all things animal. Whether as large dogs imported to the Americas to attack indigenous and African rebels or their repressive use in Standing Rock and Ferguson, B�n�dicte Boisseron<i></i><i> </i>brilliantly explores dogs as instrumental accessories in defining human essence as white, impelling readers to consider the fundamental relationship between challenging speciesism and transcending colonialism.

The entire text has been revised and geyser descriptions have been updated based on activity observed through early 2018. Information about a number of significant new geyser developments has been added, as well as recent knowledge about some of the world&#x2019;s geyser fields outside Yellowstone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both a reference work and a fine introduction to the nature of geyser activity, this popular field guide includes a glossary of key terms, a comprehensive appendix that discusses other geyser areas of the world, detailed maps of each geyser basin, and tables for easy reference. <i>The Geysers of Yellowstone</i> will continue to serve geyser gazers as well as newcomers to geothermal phenomena for years to come.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>T.

He was the author of numerous books, including <i>The Integrity of the Personality, The Dynamics of Creation, The Essential Jung,</i> and <i>The Art of Psychotherapy</i>. Dr. Storr died in 2001.Rejecting the Freudian notion that music is a form of infantile escapism, British psychologist Storr ( Solitude ) argues that music originates from the human brain, promotes order within the mind, exalts life and gives it meaning. In an engaging inquiry, Storr speculates on music's origins in preliterate societies and examines its therapeutic powers, even in people with neurological diseases that cause movement disorders. Focusing on Western classical music from Bach to Stravinsky, he rejects the view, expounded by Leonard Bernstein and others, that the Western tonal system is a universal scheme rooted in the natural order. Citing studies of physiological arousal, Storr updates Arthur Schopenhauer's thesis that music portrays the inner flow of life more directly than the other arts. He turns to Friedrich Nietzsche, a philosopher, pianist and composer, for an understanding of music as an affirmative medium that helps us transcend life's essential tragedy. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Original Sin: A Cultural History</h2><p><p> Essayist and biographer Alan Jacobs introduces us to the world of original sin, which he describes as not only a profound idea but a necessary one. As G. K. Chesterton explains, "Only with original sin can we at once pity the beggar and distrust the king." </p> <p> Do we arrive in this world predisposed to evil? St. Augustine passionately argued that we do; his opponents thought the notion was an insult to a good God. Ever since Augustine, the church has taught the doctrine of original sin, which is the idea that we are not born innocent, but as babes we are corrupt, guilty, and worthy of condemnation. Thus started a debate that has raged for centuries and done much to shape Western civilization. </p> <p> Perhaps no Christian doctrine is more controversial; perhaps none is more consequential. Blaise Pascal claimed that "but for this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we remain incomprehensible to ourselves." Chesterton affirmed it as the only provable Christian doctrine. Modern scholars assail the idea as baleful and pernicious. But whether or not we believe in original sin, the idea has shaped our most fundamental institutions&#x2014;our political structures, how we teach and raise our young, and, perhaps most pervasively of all, how we understand ourselves. In <i>Original Sin</i>, Alan Jacobs takes readers on a sweeping tour of the idea of original sin, its origins, its history, and its proponents and opponents. And he leaves us better prepared to answer one of the most important questions of all: Are we really, all of us, bad to the bone? </p></p><p>Essayist and biographer Alan Jacobs introduces us into the world of original sin, which he describes as not only a profound idea but a necessary one.

The Caf� Josephinum is a smell first, a stinging smell of roasted Turkish beans too heavy to waft on air and so waiting instead for the more powerful current of steam blown off the surface of boiling saucers fomenting to coffee. By merely snorting the vapors out of the air, patrons become overstimulated. The caf� appears in the brain as this delicious, muddy scent first, awaking a memory of the shifting room of mirrors second&#x2014;the memory nearly as energetic as the actual sight of the room, which appears in the mind only third. The coffee is a fuel to power ideas. A fuel for the anxious hope that the harvest of art and words and logic will be the richest ever because only the most fecund season will see them through the siege of this terrible winter and the siege of that terrible war. Names are made and forgotten. Famous lines are penned, along with not so famous lines. Artists pay their debt with work that colors some walls while other walls fall into an appealing decrepitude. Outside, Vienna deteriorates and rejuvenates in swatches, a motley, poorly tended garden. From out here, the windows of the coffeehouse seem to protect the crowd inside from the elements and the tedium of any given day. Inside, they laugh and smoke and shout and argue and stare and whistle as the milky brew hardens to lace along the lip of their cups.A group of scientists from the university begin to meet and throw their ideas into the mix with those of artists and novelists and visionaries who rebounded with mania from the depression that follows a nation&#x2019;s defeat. The few grow in number through invitation only. Slowly their members accumulate and concepts clump from the soup of ideas and take shape until the soup deserves a name, so they are called around Europe, and even as far as the United States, the Vienna Circle.At the center of the Circle is a circle: a clean, round, white marble tabletop. They select the Caf� Josephinum precisely for this table. A pen is passed counterclockwise. The first mark is made, an equation applied directly to the tabletop, a slash of black ink across the marble, a mathematical sentence amid the splatters. They all read the equation, homing in on the meaning amid the disordered drops. Mathematics is visual not auditory. They argue with their voices but more pointedly with their pens. They stain the marble with rays of symbolic logic in juicy black pigment that very nearly washes away.They collect here every Thursday evening to distill their ideas&#x2014;to distinguish science from superstition. At stake is Everything. Reality. Meaning. Their lives. They have lost any tolerance for ineffectual and embroidered attitudes, for mysticism or metaphysics. That is putting it too dispassionately. They <i>hate</i> mysticism and metaphysics, religion and faith. They <i>loathe</i> them. They want to separate out truth. They feel, I imagine, the near hysteria of sensing it just there, just beyond the nub of their fingers at the end of arms stretched to their limits.I&#x2019;m standing there, looking three hundred and sixty degrees around the table. Some of them stand out brighter than the others. They press forward and announce themselves. The mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath is here. She has a small but valuable part to play in this script as does her husband, Otto Neurath, the over- sized socialist. Most important, Moritz Schlick is here to form the acme and source of the Circle. Olga, whose blindness descended with the conclusion of an infection, smokes her cigar while Otto drinks lethal doses of caffeine and Moritz settles himself with a brush of his lapels. The participation of the others present today is less imperative. A circle can be approximated by a handful of discrete points and the others will not be counted. There are perhaps more significant members of the Circle over the years, but these are the people who glow in color against my grainy black-and-white image of history. A grainy, worn, poorly resolved, monochromatic picture of a still scene. I can make out details if I look the shot over carefully. Outside, a wind frozen in time burns the blurred faces of incidental pedestrians. Men pin their hats to their heads with hands gloved by wind-worn skin. Inside a grand mirror traps the window&#x2019;s images, a chunk of animated glass.In a plain, dark wooden chair near the wall, almost hidden behind the floral arm of an upholstered booth, caught in the energy and enthusiasm of that hopeful time as though caught in a sandstorm, is Kurt G�del.In 1931 he is a young man of twenty-five, his sharpest edges still hidden beneath the soft pulp of youth. He has just discovered his theorems. With pride and anxiety he brings with him this discovery. His almost, not-quite paradox, his twisted loop of reason, will be his assurance of immortality. An immortality of his soul or just his name? This question will be the subject of his madness. Can I assert that suprahuman longevity will apply only to his name? And barely even that. Even now that we live under the shadow of his discovery, his name is hardly known. His appellation denotes a theorem; he&#x2019;s an initial, not a man. Only here he is, a man in defense of his soul, in defense of truth, ready to alter the view of reality his friends have formulated on this marble table. He joins the Circle to tell the members that they are wrong, and he can prove it.G�del is taciturn, alone even in a crowd, back against the wall, looking out as though in the dark at the cinema. He is reticent but not unlikable. The attention with which his smooth hair, brushed back over his head away from his face, is creamed and tended hints at his strongest interest next to mathematics, namely women. His efforts often come to fruition, only adding to his mystery for a great many of the mathematicians around him. And while he has been known to show off a girlfriend or two, he keeps his real love a secret. His bruised apple, his sweet Adele.There is something sweet about his face too, hidden as it is behind thick-rimmed goggle glasses, inverted binoculars, so that those who are drawn into a discussion of mathematics with him feel as though they are peering into a blurry distant horizon. The completely round black frames with a thick nosepiece have the effect of accentuating his eyes or replacing them with cartoon orbs&#x2014;a physical manifestation of great metaphorical vision. They leave the suggestion, with anyone looking in, that all emphasis should be placed there on those sad windows or, more important, on the vast intellectual world that lies just beyond the focus of the binocular lenses.He speaks only when spoken to and then only about mathematics. But his responses are stark and beautiful and the very few able to connect with him feel they have discovered an invaluable treasure. His sparse counsel is sought after and esteemed. This is a youth of impressive talent and intimidating strength. This is also a youth of impressive strangeness and intimidating weakness. Maybe he has no more weaknesses than the rest of us harbor, but his all seem so extreme&#x2014;hypochondria, paranoia, schizophrenia. They are even more pronounced when laid alongside his incredible mental strengths. They appear as huge black voids, chunks taken out of an intensely shining star.He is still all potential. The potential to be great, the potential to be mad. He will achieve both magnificently.Everyone gathered on this Thursday, the rotating numbers accounting for some three dozen, believe in their very hearts that mathematics is unassailable. G�del has come tonight to shatter their belief until all that is left are convincing pieces that when assembled erect a powerful monument to mathematics, but not an unassailable one&#x2014;or at least not a complete one. G�del will prove that some truths live outside of logic and that we can&#x2019;t get there from here. Some people&#x2014;people who probably distrust mathematics&#x2014;are quick to claim that they knew all along that some truths are beyond mathematics. But they just didn&#x2019;t. They didn&#x2019;t <i>know</i> it. They didn&#x2019;t prove it.G�del didn&#x2019;t <i>believe</i> that truth would elude us. He <i>proved</i> that it would. He didn&#x2019;t invent a myth to conform to his prejudice of the world&#x2014;at least not when it came to mathematics. He discovered his theorem as surely as if it was a rock he had dug up from the ground. He could pass it around the table and it would be as real as that rock. If anyone cared to, they could dig it up where he buried it and find it just the same. Look for it and you&#x2019;ll find it where he said it is, just off center from where you&#x2019;re staring. There are faint stars in the night sky that you can see, but only if you look to the side of where they shine. They burn too weakly or are too far away to be seen directly, even if you stare. But you <i>can</i> see them out of the corner of your eye because the cells on the periphery of your retina are more sensitive to light. Maybe truth is just like that. You can see it, but only out of the corner of your eye.</p><h2>Mastering Creative Anxiety: 24 Lessons for Writers, Painters, Musicians, and Actors from America&#39;s Foremost Creativity Coach</h2><p>In his decades as a psychotherapist and creativity coach, Eric Maisel has found a common thread behind what often gets labeled writer&#x2019;s block,&#x201d; procrastination,&#x201d; or stage fright.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the particular anxiety that, paradoxically, keeps creators from doing, completing, or sharing the work they are driven toward.

But one stormy August day, furious flood water carry him off and dump him on an uninhabited island. Despite his determination and stubborn resourcefulness--he tried crossing the river with boats and ropes and even on stepping-stones--Abel can't find a way to get back home.</p><p>Days, then weeks and months, pass. Slowly, his soft habits disappear as he forages for food, fashions a warm nest in a hollow log, models clay statues of his family for company, and continues to brood on the problem of how to get across the river--and home.</p><p>Abel's time on the island brings him a new understanding of the world he's separated from. Faced with the daily adventure of survival in his solitary, somewhat hostile domain, he is moved to reexamine the easy way of life he had always accepted and discovers skills and talents in himself that hold promise of a more meaningful life, if and when he should finally return to Mossville and his dear Amanda again.</p><p><i>Abel's Island</i> is a 1976 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, and a 1977 Newbery Honor Book.</p></p><p>One summer day, newlywed mice Abel and Amanda are out for a picnic in the woods when they are caught in a sudden storm--a "full-fledged, screaming hurricane" to be precise. As they take refuge in a cave, a wind scoops up Amanda's scarf, and Abel foolishly lunges from safety to retrieve it. So begins William Steig's Newbery Honor Book <i>Abel's Island</i>, the ensuing adventures of this rather foppish mouse as he comes head to head with nature. Amazingly, Abel is swept up in a stream, then a river, then eventually marooned on an island (about 12,000 tails long). He is sure that his rescue is imminent: "It's certainly gotten around that Abelard Hassam di Chirico Flint, of the Mossville Flints, is missing," the society mouse speculates. But he is not so lucky. What will this intelligent, imaginative rodent do to get off the island and back to his beloved Amanda? He busies himself with finding ways to get to shore (including bridges, boats, catapults, stepping stones, and gliders); figuring out what he should eat (everything from mulberries to roasted seeds); and investigating where he should take shelter (in a rotten log). As the weeks and months go by, he misses his books, his paintings, his comfortable stuffed chair, his stylish clothes (now damp, torn, and lumpy), but above all his precious wife Amanda, whom he thinks about constantly. As the mouse faces his new life Robinson Crusoe-style, Abel discovers what it's like to be in tune with the natural world as well as his true nature, and what it's like to return, fortified, to his real home and to the arms of the one he loves. Along the way, readers can't help but rediscover the joys of being alive.

I pray that God will use his book Authority to Heal to teach and train you in healing ministry and encourage you to pray for the sick.

He combines the most outstanding experience in practical healing ministry with the most thorough, fresh, and penetrating scholarship as he lays out the biblical, theological, and historical analysis of the issues. This book not only tells you about the authority to heal, it shows you&#x2014;a rare combination.</p> <p>Authority to Heal is a most appropriate title for this work. This &#x201c;authority,&#x201d; long denied in church tradition, especially in Protestant theology, actually has its roots in the very core of mankind&#x2019;s experience with God.</p> <p>Adam&#x2019;s mission from God was virtually identical to that of Jesus&#x2019; disciples: 1) intimacy with God; 2) a task of &#x201c;naming&#x201d;&#x2014;announcing or proclaiming God&#x2019;s creative work; and 3) to take authority over (to &#x201c;manage&#x201d; and &#x201c;guard&#x201d; God&#x2019;s creation&#x2014;the &#x201c;guard&#x201d; part was unclear until the serpent showed up!).</p> <p>Mark 3:14&#x2013;15 is the key source for this same (though this time more successful) mandate. Jesus chose His commissioned ones to: 1) &#x201c;be with Him&#x201d;; 2) to proclaim/announce God&#x2019;s re-creative work&#x2014;the Kingdom of power; and 3) &#x201c;to take authority to cast out evil spirits&#x201d; (to tread on serpents). Authority to Heal, then, captures and proclaims the very essence of God&#x2019;s central mission to all of us!</p> <p>After surveying the vast bibliography of works on Christian healing recently produced by J.D. King, I have seen no other work that is the equal of Randy Clark&#x2019;s new book. It is simply the best. This should be the &#x201c;go to&#x201d; textbook on healing for seminaries, Bible colleges, and church mission schools.</p> <p>In His great love, </p> <p>JON RUTHVEN</p> <p>Author of What&#x2019;s Wrong with Protestant Theology?

Dr. Randy Clark offers the biblical, historical, and theological authentication of the full truth of the gospel in an excellent way. Dr. Clark is a transparent practitioner of healing and a first-rate theologian of instruction.

He believes the Bible firmly and, to the limit of his intentions and practice, seeks not only to obey it, but boldly articulate its contents.</p> <p>I love this book for its wide scope, its careful correctness, its thoroughness with precision. I cannot imagine a fairer approach combined with a bolder humility and meeker spirit than are obvious in this work.</p> <p>However, I do not buy books for their subject or writing style.

The book offers insights that will be enlightening not only to religious believers, but also to academics and skeptics who want a clearer understanding of the place of healing in the history of Christianity. The book is unique in that it both chronicles the personal experiences of one of the most influential pentecostal practitioners of healing prayer alive today and also contextualizes this narrative within well-researched theological and historical analysis. This book can serve as a useful introduction to the topic of Christian prayer for healing as well as provide new perspectives for those already well-versed in the subject.</p> <p>CANDY GUNTHER BROWN</p> <p>Professor of Religious Studies, Indiana University</p> <p>Author of Testing Prayer: Science and Healing</p> <p>As a practitioner in healing ministry who also values research regarding the history, understanding and practice of healing ministry, Randy Clark is equipped in a very special way to bridge the wide gap between practitioners and researchers.

For example, the O.J. Simpson criminal jury's verdict produced a racial divide in opinions about that trial. And many Americans still hold strong views about the jury that awarded millions of dollars to a woman who spilled a cup of McDonald's coffee on herself. It's said that there are "judicial hellholes" where local juries provide "jackpot justice" in medical malpractice and product liability cases with corporate defendants. Are these claims valid?This monumental and comprehensive volume reviews over fifty years of empirical research on civil and criminal juries and returns a verdict that strongly supports the jury system. Rather than relying on anecdotes, Vidmar and Hans&#x2015;renowned scholars of the jury system&#x2015;place the jury system in its historical and contemporary context, giving the stories behind important trials while providing fact-based answers to critical questions. How do juries make decisions and how do their verdicts compare to those of trial judges and technical experts? What roles do jury consultants play in influencing trial outcomes? Can juries understand complex expert testimony? Under which circumstances do capital juries decide to sentence a defendant to die? Are juries biased against doctors and big business? Should juries be allowed to give punitive damages? How do juries respond to the insanity defense? Do jurors ignore the law? Finally, the authors consider various suggestions for improving the way that juries are asked to carry out their duties. After briefly comparing the American jury to its counterparts in other nations, they conclude that our jury system, despite occasional problems, is, on balance, fair and democratic, and should remain an indispensable component of the judicial process for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Neil Vidmar, PhD, (Durham, NC), is both the Russell M.

Today, Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Jim Furyk provide dramatic examples. Now leading golf instructor Jim McLean shows you how to find the slot to take your game to the next level. With step-by-step instructions and more than eighty illustrations by leading golf illustrator Phil Franke, <i>The Slot Swing</i> makes it easy.</p><ul><li>Shows you how to find the perfect channel for a more powerful and consistent swing</li><li>Shares McLean's secrets from more than twenty years as a top instructor to the greatest pros</li><li>Features stunning two-color art by Phil Franke and a full-color foldout showing how the dramatically different swings of Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia, Bruce Lietzke and Jim Furyk all end up in the slot</li><li>Written by the author of the classic book <i>The 8-Step Swing,</i> named one of the 20th Century's top 15 golf instructionals by <i>Sports Illustrated</i></li></ul><p>This book helps you get out of a golfing rut, get locked in to your slot, and find the sweet spot in your game.</p></p><p><p>What's the single biggest difference between a professional golfer's swing and yours? Why is it that the pros' swings deliver such consistent power and accuracy, while you and your buddies hook, top, shank, and rack up enough mulligans to make a stew? Is it just a matter of athletic ability? Or are the pros doing something you can learn to make the ball fly straighter and farther every time you swing the club?</p><p>In The Slot Swing, Jim McLean, one of America's most well-respected and sought-after golf instructors and a pioneer in using video to analyze the swing, shows how to swing a club using the same technique that made Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Nick Price, Lorena Ochoa, Jim Furyk, and Tiger Woods champions.</p><p>One of the first things Jim noticed in his early video studies was that, contrary to conventional wisdom, none of the great golfers he studied had what was thought to be the "perfect" swing, in which the upstroke and downstroke were identical. But they did all have something in common, something that virtually all of the amateurs he studied lacked but could learn. </p><p>With the help of seventy-five amazing illustrations by Phil Frank�, as well as a brilliant color foldout with illustrations of Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia, and other leading pros, Jim shows you how, despite marked differences in backswing, all of the pros drop their clubs into a "slot" during transition. The clubshaft falls into the slot, providing better control and increased club speed at the point of impact. </p><p>Jim helps you find your way into the slot using the classic swings of three great golfers as examples: three great ball strikers using the three basic swing shapes. You'll discover how Sergio Garcia produces his seemingly effortless Standard Slot Swing, channel the amazing power of Sam Snead's Reverse Slot Swing, and marvel at the near perfection of Tiger Woods's paradoxical Single Plane Slot Swing. </p><p>Whichever of these powerful techniques suits you best, The Slot Swing will help you find the perfect downswing position that every pro hits and most amateurs miss. In no time, you'll be hitting the ball farther and straighter with any club, in any lie, with every swing you take.</p><b>How another "X Factor" can improve your swing and your game</b><p>When he began applying video analysis to the swings of professional and amateur golfers, Jim McLean quickly realized something: when he traced the plane of the clubshaft during the swing, the pros' clubshafts, nearly vertical at the three-quarter point of the backswing, were much flatter on the downswing, creating an X at the three-quarter point. No X's showed up in the traces of the amateurs' swings. In The Slot Swing, Jim shows you how to swing like a pro by dropping into the "slot" and making the X factor work for you.</p></p><h2>Lara</h2><p>Lara is a powerful semi-autobiographical novel-in-verse based on Bernardine Evaristo&#39;s own childhood and family history. The eponymous Lara is a mixed-race girl raised in a white suburb of London, during the 60s and 70s. Her father is Nigerian, and her mother is white British. Lara is the fourth of eight children and we follow her journey to adulthood from London to Nigeria to Brazil as she seeks to understand herself and her ancestry. This is a new edition of Lara, rewritten and expanded by a third since its first publication in 1997.</p><p>Bernardine Evaristo was born and raised in London, where she still lives. She has published four cross-genre novels: Lara (new edition, Bloodaxe Books, 2009); Blonde Roots (Penguin, 2008), a prose novel in which Africans enslave Europeans; a novel-with-verse, Soul Tourists (Penguin 2005), which featured ghosts of colours including Pushkin, Shakespeare&#39;s Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Alessandro dei Medici; and The Emperor&#39;s Babe (Penguin, 2001), a verse novel about a black girl growing up in Roman London nearly 2000 years ago. She co-edited the Granta new writing anthology NW15 in 2007 with novelist Maggie Gee; has written short fiction and drama for BBC radio and literary criticism for the Guardian, Times and Independent; and is an Associate Editor of the international literature magazine Wasafiri.

Eastern cultures have held breathing in high esteem for thousands of years; references to its importance are to be found in some of civilization&#39;s earliest writings. Yet even today, while modern biological and medical sciences have made great strides in exploring and understanding the details of the human organism, including respiration at the cellular level, beyond gas exchange, the larger biological function of breathing remains something of a mystery and is generally taken for granted. The New Science of Breath introduces Coherent Breathing, an exciting approach to health enhancement. It is based on the premise that while at rest the adult cardiopulmonary system, inclusive of autonomic nervous system aspects, resonates at a specific frequency, this frequency being essentially the same for all adults. When the breathing frequency is consciously aligned with this &#34;reference rhythm&#34; with appropriate depth, it results in optimal autonomic nervous system balance. Autonomic nervous system balance yields mental and physical comfort, a positive emotional outlook, enhanced health and well-being, and improved biometrics.</p><p></p><h2>Dancing at Lughnasa: A Play</h2><p><p>It is 1936 and harvest time in County Donegal.

This form of meditation, brought to the West by S.N. Geoneka, provides a means to experience emotions directly and nonverbally&#x2014;accessing the mind through the body. One of the main principles of this school of meditation is that meditation alone is not sufficient practice, but that it must be combined with a whole-life and ethical commitment.<br><br>M.Glickman's approach is unique&#x2014;he takes a mediation practice deeply rooted within a historic Buddhist framework, and gives it a modern-day, scientific spin&#x2014;he presents sensation based viapassana meditaiton and Buddhist principles in 20th-century language, secularizing ideas that may sound exotic, off-putting, or out-dated. Glickman's passion for the topic, as well as his great understanding of Buddhist concepts, make this an inspiring read.</p><p><b>Marshall Glickman</b> began meditating in 1982. He has worked as a financial consultant, writer and is the editor and publisher of the environmental journal <i>Green Living</i>. He is the author of <i>The Mindful Money Guide,</i> and his articles have appeared in many publications including <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>The Chicago Tribune</i>. He lives in Williamsville, Vermont with his wife and two daughters.Glickman is nothing if not practical, as his credentials suggest. The editor and publisher of Green Living, an environmental journal, and author of The Mindful Money Guide argues that sensation-based vipassana meditation as taught by revered Indian master S.N. Goenka is the most effective meditation method. Twenty years of meditation appear to have brought Glickman useful clarity: his meditation instructions will help beginners, his unpacking of the idea of Buddhist detachment is insightful and his correlation of new brain research results with ancient Buddhist wisdom is fresh and persuasive. When he moves beyond meditation and the insights of the four noble truths about reality, however, he overreaches. He discusses ethics, karma, nirvana as a nod to the whole complex way of seeing and being that Buddhism offers, yet here seems to be much more un-Buddhistically theoretical. His connections can be hard to grasp: Darwin's consonance with Buddhism is an intriguing idea that is under-explained, and the topic of addiction to pleasure is similarly underdeveloped. The biggest disappointment in the book, though, is the editing. Someone should have corrected the misspelling of Henepola Gunaratana's name in the bibliography as well as a dozen other distracting mistakes in text ("snacked very discretely," "severals times," "compliment and reinforce"). The book's strength is Glickman's nitty-gritty appreciation of the somatic experience of reality. The Buddha knew that suffering hurt. Glickman does well to emphasize the "mindbody" as the vehicle we humans have to drive to nirvana. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Our Lady Came to Fatima (Vision Books)</h2><p><p>Who would have thought that the Blessed Mother would choose to come to Fatima, that remote farming village on a rocky slope in Portugal?

Here, over three and a half thousand years ago, a single, cataclysmic event directed the course of western civilisation.Between 1859 and 1869, labour-gangs were employed on the island of Thera to quarry raw materials for cement. Huge amounts were needed: this was preparatory work for the construction of the new canal at Suez. The workers were after pozzolan, a powdered pumice-stone which, combined with lime, produces a cement so fine that it is like plaster; they were digging in the right place. Here were layers of pumice a full 10 m thick: the tell-tale sign of massive geo-physical activity. The volcanic island of Thera had erupted a number of times, and as the navvies dug deeper and deeper it became clear that the most spectacular explosion pre-dated the Romans, the classical Greeks and Homer himself. When the pick-axes finally hit the bedrock, the workers had made their way through extruded volcanic material 3,500 years old to the archaeological level of the Aegean Bronze Age. What was being quarried was the fall-out of a gargantuan natural disaster.The landscape of present-day Thera still signals the force of an earth that is uneasy. Take a little boat out to the collapsed centre of the volcano and you crunch your way through its hills and hummocks built up of dusty, aerated lava. Pumice stones skitter and slide underfoot at the approach to the volcano&#x2019;s centre. The ground still breathes out attenuated plumes and wisps of smoke. Footpaths wind past giant rocky outcrops: once molten ooze, these subterranean minerals have now hardened into titanic chunks of shiny, black, broken treacle. For centuries, the Theran landscape would have been a stark aide-memoire, telling the ancients that men were mere matchwood when it came to the anger of the earth, the sea and the sky.Thera is a shocking and savage enough place today &#x2013; just imagine it as the volcano erupted around 1550 bc. Earthquakes a month or so before would have been the first signal that the gods were uneasy. Then the massive mountain in the sea would have started to exhale clouds of ash, a dark stain in the sky, an ugly blur visible for a hundred miles. With a scream of released pressure, steam would have escaped in voluminous billows and tight jet-blasts. And then the coup de th��tre: between 30 and 40 km of pumice, rock-shards and ash hurtling into the atmosphere in the giant eruption column. Magma spewing up from the volcano&#x2019;s mouth; pyroclastic flows leaving deposits 20 to 50 m thick in some places; electrical storms ripping open the sky.Although it may have taken only three or four days for the volcano to erupt, the effects were far-reaching. The global temperature would have gone down as volcanic aerosols were released, blocking solar radiation to the earth&#x2019;s surface. As far away as Lake Golcuk in the Bozdag mountain range in Turkey, 320 miles north-east of Thera, a 12 cm-thick layer of Theran tephra has been found. Sediment cores from the Black Sea also contain Theran material. Ash would have drifted over an area of 500,000 square km, smothering crops, stifling livestock.Following the volcanic eruption there were other horrors to come. As sea water was displaced by the shift of the earth and rushed into the collapsed magma chamber &#x2013; the newly gaping Theran caldera sinking over 480 m below sea level &#x2013; a giant wave, a tsunami, began to gather and hurtle towards shores in the region. It is estimated that the largest tsunami created by the eruption of Thera &#x2013; just one in a train of waves &#x2013; would have been up to 12 m high, travelling at well over 160 km per hour.6 Just 111 km away, the north coast of Crete was particularly badly hit. Near the Bronze Age palace of Malia on the island, tiny fossilised sea-shells have been found in mud deposits, shells that under normal conditions exist only in deep ocean. Small boats would have been plucked from the shallows and hurled onto the hills. And as the decomposing bodies of the volcano&#x2019;s victims were washed back ashore, diarrhoeal diseases &#x2013; cholera and typhoid &#x2013; would have spread. The destruction and death toll would have been immense. The Bronze Age world was brutalised.But for one group of people who lived in scattered settlements on the Greek mainland, the explosion of Thera offered an unexpected opportunity.From the 19th to the 15th centuries bc, the islanders of Crete &#x2013; the Minoans (thus named in 1895 by the archaeologist Arthur Evans after the legendary ruler of Crete, King Minos) &#x2013; had dominated the sea-ways of the Aegean. Floating between Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Minoans successfully exploited their pole position. For five hundred years communities around the Eastern Mediterranean not only traded with &#x2018;the people of Keftiu&#x2019;, as the Minoans were probably known in the Bronze Age, but also followed their political and religious lead. Secure on their island home, the Minoans were wealthy, vigorous and influential. They have been described as a &#x2018;thalassocracy&#x2019; &#x2013; a sea-power, rulers of the waves.The eruption of Thera changed Minoan fortunes. This was a sophisticated culture, a culture that relied on contacts with the outside world to keep its workshops fed with tin and copper, with semi-precious stones and with oils and unguents. But all boats moored along the busy north and east coasts of the island &#x2013; a fleet essential for Minoan well-being &#x2013; would have been destroyed by the tsunami that followed the Thera eruption. Patterns of trade and communication across the Aegean were disrupted. Vital farmland was flooded. As refugees fled Thera itself they could have brought with them unfamiliar pathogens which would have radiated quickly from the crowded shanty towns that mushroomed on Cretan coastlines.The psychological impact of the disaster must have been far-reaching. For a fundamentally superstitious pre-historic culture like the Minoans, a perversion of nature such as this could be explained only in spiritual terms. The column of water which appeared from nowhere and hit the island at a horrifying, incomprehensible speed, the eerie afterglow of the volcanic explosion hanging on the horizon, must have been interpreted as momentous signs from enraged gods. The confidence of the Minoans &#x2013; who had, for centuries, seemed blessed &#x2013; would have been shaken to its core.Helen&#x2019;s Mycenaean ancestors were equipped to step into the breach.The Mycenaean civilisation first comes into focus around 1700 bc. Centred on mainland Greece &#x2013; particularly its southern landmass, the Peloponnese &#x2013; the Mycenaeans founded citadels, carved up agricultural districts and established a network of roads and trade-routes. This was a well-organised, ambitious and materialistic culture; each generation of the warrior-elite expanded Mycenaean territories and the treasure stores of Mycenaean palaces. As the Mycenaeans looked to the south, Minoan palaces and ports must have tempted them &#x2013; control of Cretan territories would have offered a clear trade-route through to Egypt and across to Asia Minor. It is little surprise that after years as a fledgling culture, when the Mycenaeans decided to spread their wings, they had Crete in their sights. Thera&#x2019;s explosion triggered a political as well as a geological shift in power.Throughout the 16th century bc the Minoans appear slowly to lose their grip on the Aegean; then, around 1450 bc we find Mycenaean pottery simply replacing Minoan artefacts. At the great palace complex of Knossos in the north of the island, a Mycenaean administration takes the reins. Across the island, fires destroy all other palatial centres. All Minoan administrative records come to be written in the Greek language. Independent Minoan culture is eclipsed. For the next three hundred years it would be the Mycenaean Greeks, not the Minoans, who dominated the region. Following the eruption of Thera, the leaders of the mainland Greeks slowly join the ranks of the most powerful men on earth &#x2013; by the 13th century bc Helen&#x2019;s ancestors are, like the rulers of Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria and Anatolia, described as &#x2018;Great Kings&#x2019;.And so, although many artists have imagined Helen and her peers as soft, sun-kissed creatures, wafting indolently in front of classically fluted columns in diaphanous chitons, if we are to hold in our mind a picture of the real women of the Late Bronze Age and the environment they inhabited, we must add harsher colours to the palette.The eruption of Thera was the most showy disaster in the Late Bronze Age, but there were others. This was a fragile, edgy epoch in which communities were frequently destabilised by both political and environmental forces. The Eastern Mediterranean stretches over a tectonic-plate boundary &#x2013; a zone where two plates in the earth&#x2019;s crust push and pull like testy lovers; Helen&#x2019;s story is set in one of the most seismic &#x2013; as well as one of the most volcanic &#x2013; regions of the world. In addition to the extreme eruption of Thera, for the Late Bronze Age populations of the Aegean natural disasters were regular and unwelcome visitors. There were &#x2018;storms&#x2019; of earthquakes, as well as unusually frequent cosmic activity. From the 14th to the 12th centuries, on average, the Peloponnese would have suffered an earth tremor, an earthquake, or a cosmic strike every decade.Across the Bronze Age Aegean there is evidence of these disasters in the form of &#x2018;destruction layers&#x2019; &#x2013; jumbled masses of disjointed architecture, artefacts, plant and animal remains. Everyday objects in the archaeological strata are in unlikely places or positions. In the most extreme examples, debris has been pulverised or burnt, human bones are crushed in rubble; the disorder bears witness to moments of great crisis. At Thebes &#x2013; the main Mycenaean settlement in Boiotia, central Greece, which Homer tells us contributed fifty ships to the Trojan War effort &#x2013; a destruction layer from a Mycenaean building on the hill of Kadmeia is a full metre thick. Trapped in one horribly compressed upper room is a skeleton, probably that of a woman aged between twenty and twenty-five, who seems to have been killed by a violent blow to the head as the building was ripped apart.Destruction layers witness trauma. They are public signifiers of private tragedies &#x2013; but there were also devastating events that leave little archaeological trace. Landslides and dust-clouds, water springs blocked at the source, flash floods, rivers diverted: life abrupted.15 From 1800 to 1100 bc many of the settlements in the Eastern Mediterranean appear to have been hit not once, but repeatedly.16 Helen&#x2019;s inheritance was vexed. She was born as a woman or as an idea when heaven and earth were in pugnacious mood. The mortar binding the foundation myths in a court such as hers would have been streaked with blood. The Mycenaeans clawed their way to prominence in the Eastern Mediterranean over rubble and detritus and broken lives; theirs was an ascent back-lit by flames. As they reach supremacy in the 13th century bc, the smell of death &#x2013; whether brought by man or by nature &#x2013; still hangs in the air.Little surprise that Helen&#x2019;s story is brooding and uncomfortable.Chapter 2A RAPE, A BIRTHA shudder in the loins engenders thereThe broken wall, the burning roof and towerAnd Agamemnon dead.&#x2014;W.B. Yeats, &#x2018;Leda and the Swan&#x2019; (1928)Helen&#x2019;s traditional breeding-place, the Peloponnese in the southern Greek mainland, is, even when not rocked by natural disasters, a place of extremes. In her home town, Sparta, summer temperatures can reach up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), while in the winter choking mists clog up the valleys and the almond trees are laced with hoar-frost. High in the mountains that ring the town, there are icicles the size of a grown man. Widows at the roadside will tell how the weak and very poor still die from the cold. This can be a savage land and it has given birth to correspondingly savage stories.Helen&#x2019;s conception is a prime example. According to Greek myths, Helen came from good stock, but her genesis was violent. Her father, Zeus, was chief among the pantheon on Mount Olympus. Helen was Zeus&#x2019; cherished and only mortal daughter. Her mother, Leda,1 the wife of Tyndareus, King of Sparta, was famed for her beauty. One day, as Leda bathed on the banks of the Eurotas, the lush river that irrigates the Spartan plain, Zeus saw the young queen and was enraptured. Determined to have Leda, he turned himself into a giant swan and raped her.In classical Athens, remembering these distant stories, the chorus in Euripides&#x2019; play Helen bemoans the moment: &#x2018;so sorrowful was that destiny, lady mine, that befell you, a life better unlived given to you, yes given, when Zeus blazed in the bright air, in the snowflash of the swan&#x2019;s wing to beget you upon your mother. What grief is there you have not known? What in life have you not lived through?It was a beginning recalled as being at once brutal and erotic. In a mosaic from a sanctuary of Aphrodite at Paphos on Cyprus a gloriously plump-bottomed Leda, with her back to us, runs the edge of her gossamer shawl over the swan&#x2019;s beak. Early Greek representations of the story are relatively tame, the bird small, with Leda simply petting him. But as time goes on, the bird grows bigger, the atmosphere more violent. In Argos, a tombstone commissioned by a rich Greek merchant immortalises in marble the moment when the swan enters the young woman. The sculpture stands at the entrance of the small Argos Museum. Leda is doubled over &#x2013; in pain or in ecstasy &#x2013; her hand making its way towards her vulva. It is impossible to tell whether she is trying to drag Zeus out or help him in. In a wall-painting from Herculaneum, the town buried along with Pompeii by the eruption of Vesuvius in ad 79, the fowl-god bites Leda&#x2019;s neck. Michelangelo&#x2019;s 16th-century Leda seems to be abandoned to sensual pleasure; after its donation in 1838, a copy of the painting was hung in the office of the director of London&#x2019;s National Gallery rather than put on display as it was considered inappropriate for the public gaze.</p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction: Thirty-Fourth Annual Collection (Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction, 34)</h2><p>In the new millennium, what secrets lay beyond the far reaches of the universe?

Today it goes under names such as apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, Josephus and Philo, apocalyptic literature and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Mishnah and targums. But line by line, scroll by scroll, it represents the history and theology, the hopes and prayers of a living and diverse Judaism. It is an engrossing subject in and of itself, but for students of the New Testament it offers an invaluable context for understanding the words and actions of Jesus as well as the conversion and thinking of Paul. <em>Exploring Jewish Literature of the Second Temple Period</em> is an introduction to this literature and places it within its historical context. Riding the explosive growth of knowledge of this period, Larry R. Helyer guides students to the heart of the matter. What were the pressures and realities, the questions and dreams that nurtured and provoked these written expressions? And how does this literature throw light on the text of the New Testament and origins of Christianity?</p><p>For twenty nine years Larry R. Helyer was professor of biblical studies at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana. Now retired, he continues to write on theological topics and serve as an adjunct professor in the United States and abroad. He is the author of <em>Exploring Jewish Literature of the Second Temple Period</em>."In this comprehensive and well-informed volume, Larry Helyer provides an exemplary introduction to the world of Second Temple Judaism, its history and its literature. What is distinctive about Helyer's work is his deliberate reading of this material with the New Testament in mind. In so doing he is able to show how deeply Jewish the New Testament is and how knowledge of this material can enrich our reading of the New Testament. This book is impressive not only for the high quality of its scholarship but also for its exceptional clarity and judiciousness. Especially commendable are Helyer's positive attitude to things Jewish and his adamant rejection of anti-Semitism. Highly recommended!" (Donald A. Hagner, George Eldon Ladd Professor Emeritus of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There are many useful books on Second Temple Jewish literature, for which reason I nearly passed this book by. But once I began actually examining it, I recognized the thoroughness of Larry Helyer's acquaintance with the sources and how carefully he has prepared this book with New Testament students in mind. I believe it will provide an excellent resource for those who want access to the most important materials for New Testament study." (Craig S. Keener, Professor of New Testament, Palmer Seminary)<br><br>"The literature of Second Temple Judaism is so vast that few college or seminary students ever receive a decent introduction to it at all. Here, in one volume, are references to judicious samplings from every major corpus, complete with introduction and background, and detailed explanation of relevance for New Testament studies. A wonderful gift for students and professors alike. Perhaps many will now actually teach, and teach substantially, on the topic!" (Craig L.

Ranging across calligraphy, painting, architecture, literature, music, and the plastic arts, Nasr penetrates to the inner dimension of Islam and shows the role art plays in the life of individual Muslims and the community as a whole--the role of inspiring the remembrance and contemplation of God.<br><br> Once the author establishes art as an aid and support to the spiritual life, he traces the creative act to its ultimate source: inner knowledge and barakah, or grace, which make the crystallization of inner realities in form and space and time possible. Through this knowledge and grace, the author asserts, unity manifests upon the plane of multiplicity, making archetypal realities perceivable by the senses. Through this knowledge and grace, art functions as a ladder for the journey of the soul from the visible to the invisible. How Islamic art leads man to the inner chamber of divine revelation forms the substance of much of this important work.<br><br> An especially close look is given to the Sufi tradition within Islam, for its mystical teachers have often clearly demonstrated in their works the spiritual significance of beauty and served as the source of inspiration for art.<br><br> By rediscovering the root of art in the Islamic tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr opens doors to new dimensions of unity which have seemingly been obscured in recent Western art. In so doing, he extends the significance of this book beyond the Islamic belief system to touch the hearts and creative impulses of readers from all traditions.<br><br> <b>Seyyed Hossein Nasr</b> is currently University Professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University.

And how do our imaginations leap into worlds way beyond our real experiences?<br><i>The Silence of Animals</i> is consistently fascinating, filled with unforgettable images and a delight in the conundrum of human existence&#x2015;an existence that we decorate with countless myths and ideas, where we twist and turn to avoid acknowledging that we too are animals, separated from the others perhaps only by our self-conceit. In the Babel we have created for ourselves, it is the silence of animals that both reproaches and bewitches us.</p></p><p><b>John Gray</b> is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>The Immortalization Commission</i>, <i>Black Mass</i>, and <i>Straw Dogs</i>.

This splendid trekking route, lying 25-30 miles north of the Arctic Circle runs from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut (both of which have airport access). The trail traverses remote, empty, silent and stunningly scenic arctic tundra, and is mostly gently graded with just a few short, steep and rocky slopes. However, the landscape between the two towns of Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut is extremely remote and those who choose to take on this route must be competely self-sufficient. The book includes plenty of practical information on what to take with you and when to go, as well as on safety, travel and accommodation. Fully illustrated with a variety of photographs and its route is highlighted on continuous trekking maps. The guide also includes an optional extension to the Greenlandic ice cap.</p></p><p><p>Paddy Dillon is a prolific outdoor writer with over 60 guidebooks to his name, as well as more than a dozen booklets and brochures.

Dark. Deserted.<br> <br>Except for the corpse hanging in the living room.<br> <br>Or whatever the hell rich people called the big, fancy room where nobody ever actually lived. Approximately the size of a football field with the white marble floors and the giant crystal chandeliers dangling overhead. This one, just like the rest of the house, was empty, its furnishings and other accoutrements in storage somewhere waiting for the government to auction them off.<br> <br>&#x201c;You should&#x2019;ve talked when you had the chance, Jeffy-boy,&#x201d; Finn Bradley said to the corpse as he grimly surveyed it. His voice was soft, but the words seemed to echo off the pale marble walls&#x2014;hell, for all he knew the ceiling was marble. It soared thirty feet above his head, which made it kind of hard to tell.<br> <br>The electricity had been cut off, so pale moonlight pouring in through the windows was all he had to go by, but he was confident that the death looked like a suicide.<br> <br>Except that Finn knew it wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Jeff Cowan, the twenty-nine-year-old son of disgraced financier George Cowan, who had made off with billions of investor dollars in one of the biggest financial frauds in history, had just become one more piece of collateral damage in the war to recover the missing money. Jeff was slight&#x2014;okay, so maybe nearly everybody seemed slight when compared to Finn&#x2019;s own six-three, 220-pound self&#x2014;blond, and classically handsome. He&#x2019;d had the most expensive of educations. The most expensive of everythings. His parents had doted on him. He had a host of rich-scion&#x2013;type friends. Yet here he was, his bare feet dangling at approximately Finn&#x2019;s eye level, wearing a pair of gym shorts and a T-shirt, his face contorted in death, the smell of ammonia from where he had pissed himself stinking up the air around him. To all outward appearances, he had wrapped an electrical cord around his neck, attached one end to the wrought iron railing of the second-floor gallery looking down on the room, and leaped over, thus breaking his own damned neck.<br> <br>Finding a motive was easy: the shame of his father&#x2019;s crime, the unaccustomed poverty into which Jeff had been plunged, the relentless investigations as every law enforcement agency under the sun tried to ferret out who else had been involved in the fraud and what had happened to the money, had proved to be too much for the pampered darling of one of Houston&#x2019;s wealthiest families. The ME could bring in a suicide verdict and nobody would question it.<br> <br>Only a select few would know the verdict was bullshit.<br> <br>Finn wrapped a hand around Cowan&#x2019;s wrist. He&#x2019;d seen enough death to know what it looked like, so he didn&#x2019;t bother to check for a pulse. What he was checking for was body temperature.<br> <br>Cowan was still warm. No sign of rigor mortis. No sign of blood pooling in the extremities. The smell of urine was still strong.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d been dead under an hour. Maybe way under an hour. As in he could have been killed in the last fifteen minutes or so.<br> <br>Shit.<br> <br>It was possible that whoever had killed him was still around. Finn tightened his grip on his gun as he scanned the room, paying particular attention to the nearly impenetrable darkness shrouding the overhead gallery. He didn&#x2019;t get the feeling that anyone was up there, but&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;You find Cowan?&#x201d; inquired the voice in his head. At least, that was how Finn thought of his unwanted partner, David Baxter. The earwig was almost as bad as having Baxter in there with him. Not quite, though. Bax tended to lose his cool when things didn&#x2019;t go according to plan. If he&#x2019;d been standing there beside Finn at that moment instead of waiting in a parked car across the street from the ornate iron gates that were closed and padlocked by order of the U.S. government, Bax would be shitting bricks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Finn replied, then added, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>The shit bricks started to drop, as Finn had known they would. Bax&#x2019;s voice went shrill.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t wait for Finn&#x2019;s confirmation, because he knew Finn wasn&#x2019;t a joking-around kind of guy. &#x201c;Goddamn it! You weren&#x2019;t supposed to kill him!&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Finn could reply, the distant, barely audible click of a door being unlocked had him pivoting in the direction from which it had come. There was no mistaking the subsequent sounds: somebody was coming in the front door.<br> <br>His eyes narrowed. His muscles tensed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; he growled at Bax, who was supposed to be keeping watch. &#x201c;Do your fucking job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Bax sputtered. &#x201c;Me? Me do my job? You fucking do yours! You said you thought he was in the house. When we got here, and you went in, you said you wanted to talk to him. You didn&#x2019;t say anything about killing&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>That was all Finn heard, because as he retreated into the shadows at the far side of the room he savagely pulled the damned annoying piece of plastic out of his ear and shoved it into his pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;JEFF?&#x201d; RILEY COWAN called. Her voice was tight with anger.<br> <br>She knew that flipping on the light switch near the door was a waste of time. The electricity had been shut off weeks before for nonpayment, shortly before the government had seized the house, but out of habit she flipped the switch anyway. Big surprise: the darkness stayed dark. Fortunately she knew her way around. Her former in-laws&#x2019; former mansion once had been her home, too. She and Jeff had lived with them for nearly a year, until Jeff had finished the in-house training program his father had insisted he complete before buying their own lavish condo in downtown Houston. When Jeff had first brought her here, she&#x2019;d been a twenty-�one-year-old newlywed straight from Philadelphia&#x2019;s poverty-�stricken North Side, where she&#x2019;d been working as a cocktail waitress to put herself through college. Jeff&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; wealth had been as much of a surprise to her as her existence had been to them. That was seven years ago. A lot had changed since then. To begin with, she and Jeff were divorced, and had been for a year and a half.<br> <br>Riley waited just inside the front door: Jeff didn&#x2019;t answer, didn&#x2019;t appear. Oakwood&#x2014;all the mansions in Houston&#x2019;s exclusive River Oaks neighborhood had names&#x2014;was a big place, eight bedrooms, ten baths, fifteen thousand sumptuous square feet, with its own swimming pool and tennis court and guest/staff house. Given that, even though Jeff was expecting her it was possible that he hadn&#x2019;t heard her calling him. It was also possible that he was drunk off his ass and passed out somewhere, or so drugged up he was practically out of his mind. Actually, knowing him, one of those scenarios was more than possible: it was likely.<br> <br>The question she should be asking herself was, exactly how had she ended up becoming her ex-husband&#x2019;s keeper?<br> <br>He&#x2019;d tried calling her first. When she hadn&#x2019;t answered, he&#x2019;d texted her: I got trouble. Meet me at the house ASAP.<br> <br>Typical Jeff: the only thing he ever thought about was what he needed. The sad part was, she hadn&#x2019;t followed through on her impulse to text back, Go to hell.<br> <br>Instead, here she was. Stupid much?<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been finishing up at work when the text had come through. As one of two assistant managers of the Palm Room, one of Houston&#x2019;s most exclusive clubs, she was in charge of closing for the night on weekends, which Jeff knew. This was Saturday&#x2014;well, Sunday now, because it was after 3 a.m.&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d known that she would be leaving work just about the time he sent the text. For about three seconds she&#x2019;d thought about ignoring it, ignoring him&#x2014;working two jobs as she was doing tended to leave her exhausted at the end of the week, and she&#x2019;d had just about enough of pulling his chestnuts out of the fire&#x2014;but Jeff had been so unstable lately that she hadn&#x2019;t been able to bring herself to do it. She hadn&#x2019;t blasted him, either. Instead, she&#x2019;d come.<br> <br>Just like he&#x2019;d known she would.<br> <br>Because, despite everything he&#x2019;d put her through, despite the drinking and drugs and other women that had torpedoed their marriage, part of her still cared about him. When he wasn&#x2019;t under the influence of something, he was kind and gentle. He&#x2019;d been sensitive to her feelings at a time when she&#x2019;d needed somebody to be. He was handsome, athletic, and sometimes even charming. She was no longer in love with him&#x2014;thank God; loving Jeff had been a nightmare&#x2014;but during the tumultuous years they&#x2019;d been together he&#x2019;d somehow managed to become family to her.<br> <br>Didn&#x2019;t mean she couldn&#x2019;t get ticked off at him for dragging her out at this ungodly hour to this place that was full of bad memories and was government property now, even if the authorities hadn&#x2019;t yet gotten around to doing anything beyond officially seizing it, which so far hadn&#x2019;t included changing the locks. The front gates were padlocked, for God&#x2019;s sake: she&#x2019;d had to park in a neighbor&#x2019;s driveway&#x2014;she recalled that they always spent the summer in Maine, so no one was home to notice or be disturbed&#x2014;and walk across about an acre of the neighbor&#x2019;s grounds before coming through the garden gate, which the government either didn&#x2019;t know about yet or didn&#x2019;t care about. Trespassing was what she was doing on Jeff&#x2019;s behalf, and last time she&#x2019;d checked that was a crime.<br> <br>The knowledge that she was committing a criminal act for him ticked her off even more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeff?&#x201d; Anger sharpened her voice.<br> <br>Still no answer.<br> <br>Damn it&#x2014;him&#x2014;anyway.<br> <br>Standing in the cavernous hallway calling to him obviously wasn&#x2019;t going to get the job done. Lips firming, high heels clicking on the vast expanse of white marble floor that was missing the pricey Oriental rugs that had softened it just like the house itself was missing its paintings and furnishings and the bowls of fresh flowers (changed every other day) and the uniformed staff that had made it so intimidating to the new bride she had once been, she walked away from the elongated rectangle of moonlight that spilled through the door she&#x2019;d left open behind her and into the deepening darkness. The house used to smell of furniture polish and flowers: tonight it smelled of mildew and some indefinable stink. Inside, it was hot as an oven because this was Houston in July, and the air-conditioning had gone with the electricity.<br> <br>Coming from Jeff, I got trouble could mean anything, from I&#x2019;m too drunk to drive home to I&#x2019;m dead broke and need to borrow a hundred bucks. Now that he was no longer vice president of Cowan Investments, the defunct family firm, he was essentially unemployed. To be fair, that wasn&#x2019;t entirely his fault. Nobody in Houston, or in Texas, or possibly even the United States or the whole wide world, was going to employ George Cowan&#x2019;s only son, especially when the feds still suspected that he&#x2019;d aided his father in his schemes and were investigating him relentlessly. (Jeff hadn&#x2019;t had a thing to do with it; he&#x2019;d been as clueless about the whole mess as she had been herself.) Of course, there was always employment available at places like McDonald&#x2019;s, or Wal-Mart, as Riley&#x2019;s exasperation had recently led her to snap at him, but she&#x2019;d known even as she&#x2019;d said it that the idea of Jeff Cowan working a minimum-wage job was laughable.<br> <br>It just wasn&#x2019;t in his DNA.<br> <br>Good thing she wasn&#x2019;t such a delicate flower, or they&#x2019;d all starve. She&#x2019;d said that to him, too, when she&#x2019;d handed over most of her paycheck a couple of weeks ago to help pay the rent on the house he now shared with his mother and teenage sister.<br> <br>The problem was, none of the three of them had ever had to work for money in their lives, and they were floundering. Whereas, until she&#x2019;d married Jeff, she&#x2019;d always had to work if she wanted to eat and have a roof over her head, so she had the whole get-a-second-job-if-you-have-to thing down.<br> <br>Jeff didn&#x2019;t even have the whole get-a-first-job thing down.<br> <br>When she&#x2019;d become part of their family, she&#x2019;d never been anything but poor, never lived in anything except run-down apartments. Her only travel had been an occasional summer trip by car to Florida. The rich, glamorous Cowans had been as alien to her as if they&#x2019;d been from Mars. Margaret, Jeff&#x2019;s mother, was one of Houston&#x2019;s leading socialites. She could have treated her new daughter-in-law like dirt, could have looked down her nose, could have been snobby and cold to her. Instead Margaret had embraced her, treating Rily like a daughter from the moment Jeff had showed up with her. She&#x2019;d taught her how to dress, how to navigate the upper echelons of society, how to do the philanthropy thing. When they&#x2019;d had money, they had showered her with everything that money could buy. Now that they didn&#x2019;t, now that they&#x2019;d suffered this humiliating, terrifying fall from grace, she wasn&#x2019;t about to turn her back on them. They were her family now. She would help them if she could, any way she could. And Jeff knew that about her. It was, he&#x2019;d told her, one of the reasons he&#x2019;d fallen in love with her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeff?&#x201d; Okay, she was screeching now.<br> <br>Her voice was still echoing off the walls as she paused at the first arched doorway to her left. It opened into a corridor that led to the green salon, the sunroom, and the music room. An identical arched doorway to her right led to the library and the card room and the conservatory. When she&#x2019;d first arrived at Oakwood, she&#x2019;d thought, Geez, who has rooms like that? Now it seemed normal to have pretentiously named rooms that were rarely used.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeff?&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no answer. Jeff was probably either in the billiards room, which had built-in cushioned benches that could double as a bed, or out back in the pool area, she calculated. Either choice required her to traverse thousands of square feet of unnervingly empty house. She figured that a better idea would be to first go through the gathering room&#x2014;a fancy name for what was really a big family room&#x2014;and check out the pool area, which might save her from needing to go all the way down to the lower level, where the billiards room was located.<br> <br>It would serve him right if I just turned around and left.<br> <br>But Riley knew she wouldn&#x2019;t, because to do so would undoubtedly mean spending the rest of the night worrying about him.<br> <br>Jeff, you ass.<br> <br>Her phone was already clutched tightly in her hand: she pressed a button and held it up, using it as a flashlight. The faint white beam was woefully inadequate, but it was all she had. She continued on toward the gathering room with dogged determination, refusing to let a little thing like a huge, dark, echoingly empty house spook her.<br> <br>Yeah, right. Who are you kidding?<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeff?&#x201d; she shouted again.<br> <br>The twin white marble staircases with their black wrought iron railings curved like swans&#x2019; necks over her head to meet up on the second-floor landing. Faint sounds&#x2014;a creak, a hiss, a rattle&#x2014;�made her breath catch. She shot a quick glance upward, then aimed the beam of light that way. Nothing but a whole lot of dark. Any one of the sounds might have been made by Jeff, but then again, they could have been made by anything. Houses settle, she reminded herself firmly as she continued on, but that didn&#x2019;t really help the creeping uneasiness that was making the back of her neck prickle.<br> <br>The mansion felt . . . alive. That was the only way she knew how to describe it. There was a kind of pulsing energy to it that was distinctly unsettling. It was almost like the house had a heartbeat that was throbbing around her. If she&#x2019;d been imaginative, which thank God she wasn&#x2019;t, she would have sworn that she could hear it breath...</p><h2>Lebanon (Bradt Travel Guide)</h2><p>This new edition of Bradt's <em>Lebanon</em> remains the most comprehensive and detailed English-language guide available.

He lives in New York City.</p>Introduction<br>Early in April of 1840, a young British traveler arrived in the dusty provincial capital of Mosul in what is now northern Iraq. Restless, ambitious, and completely unsure of what he should do with his life, Austen Henry Layard had just spent several months wandering around Greece, Turkey, and the Levant, admiring the monumental ruins left by the Greeks and Romans throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Now he was venturing into unsettled regions rarely visited by European travelers, for it was said that uncharted sites around Mosul held imposing remains of Nineveh and other ancient Assyrian cities. The reports Layard had heard were both true and false: the sites were there, yet when Layard went out to them, he was astonished to discover that there was nothing to see. All that remained of the great Mesopotamian civilizations were formless mounds of earth, forty or fifty feet high and up to a mile wide, with not one temple, not one pillar, not one sculpture in sight.<br>Far from disappointing him, the desolation of the Assyrian sites only fired Layard&#x2019;s imagination. As he later wrote, a traveler crossing the Euphrates would seek in vain for &#x201c;the graceful column rising above the thick foliage of the myrtle&#x201d; or the elegant curves of an amphitheater above a sparkling bay. &#x201c;He is now at a loss to give any form to the rude heaps upon which he is gazing,&#x201d; Layard continued. &#x201c;The more he conjectures, the more vague the results appear. The scene around is worthy of the ruin he is contemplating; desolation meets desolation; a feeling of awe succeeds to wonder; for there is nothing to relieve the mind, to lead to hope, or to tell of what has gone by.&#x201d; Then and there, Layard resolved that he would be the one to uncover the history buried in the bleak mounds before him.<br>Layard and a handful of other archaeological explorers soon embarked on one of the most dramatic intellectual adventures of modern times: the opening up of three thousand years of history in the cradle of civilization. Layard led the way with spectacular discoveries at two different sites. At a site south of Mosul, he uncovered beautifully carved reliefs and a set of magnificent, human-headed winged bulls that became centerpieces of the British Museum&#x2019;s collection; across the Tigris from Mosul he found the long-buried ruins of Nineveh. There he discovered the vast palace built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib, its endless corridors and seventy rooms lined with two full miles&#x2019; worth of carved reliefs; not for nothing had Sennacherib named it &#x201c;Palace Without Rival.&#x201d;<br>As spectacular as the carvings were, Layard&#x2019;s most important find was literary: he and his Iraqi friend and assistant Hormuzd Rassam uncovered the major library assembled by Sennacherib&#x2019;s grandson, Ashurbanipal. Layard and Rassam shipped a hundred thousand clay tablets and fragments back to the British Museum, and these proved to be keys to uncovering the region&#x2019;s ancient history and its rich literature. The greatest of the thousands of texts that Layard and Rassam brought to light is The Epic of Gilgamesh, the first great masterpiece of world literature.<br>This book tells the story of that long-buried book, a history of imperial conflict and of cross-cultural cooperation. During the epic&#x2019;s varied life, it has cut across many of the divides that arose during the long history of the intertwined civilizations that flourished in Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean. Gilgamesh links East and West, antiquity and modernity, poetry and history, and its echoes can be found in the Bible, in Homer, and in The Thousand and One Nights. At the same time the epic illuminates the profound conflicts that persist within each culture, and within the human heart itself. &#x201c;Why,&#x201d; Gilgamesh&#x2019;s divine mother Ninsun asks the sun god, &#x201c;did you afflict my son Gilgamesh with so restless a spirit?&#x201d;<br>As it unfolds, The Epic of Gilgamesh becomes a searching meditation on the nature of culture. After ill-advised adventures lead to the sudden death of his beloved friend Enkidu, Gilgamesh is overwhelmed with despair and a deep fear of death. He abandons his city and goes in search of immortality, whose secret he believes he can learn from his ancestor Uta-napishtim, miraculous survivor of the Flood that swept over the earth centuries before. After a long and perilous journey Gilgamesh finally meets Uta-napishtim, only to find that he cannot transcend the human condition after all. Gilgamesh&#x2019;s quest may have failed, but along the way he learns lessons about just and unjust rule, political seductions and sexual politics, and the vexed relations among humanity, the gods, and the world of nature.<br>Though it is one of the earliest explorations of these perennial themes, this haunting poem isn&#x2019;t a timeless classic, in the sense in which Ben Jonson spoke of Shakespeare&#x2019;s works as &#x201c;not of an age, but for all time.&#x201d; Instead, Gilgamesh has lived in two very different ages, the ancient and the modern, and only in these. A story of the fragile triumph of culture in the face of death, the epic strangely came to illustrate its own theme through its turbulent history. It was widely read in the Near East for a thousand years, until it vanished amid the eclipse of the region&#x2019;s ancient cultures, buried under successive waves of empire, from the Persians to the Romans and their successors. The epic was buried in ruin mounds along with Mesopotamia&#x2019;s entire written production, as people stopped speaking the region&#x2019;s older languages and lost even the ability to read the cuneiform script in which the works were written. Unexpectedly, the epic reemerged in the nineteenth century into a scene of renewed imperial conflict, involving Arabs, Turks, Persians, Kurds, Chechens, Jews, Englishmen, Russians, and others in the waning years of the Ottoman Empire. The choices these rivals made in the nineteenth century set the stage for the conflicts being played out in Iraq today.<br>Layard and Rassam uncovered Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s great library, but they had no way to know what it contained, for no one in the world could read the intricate cuneiform characters inscribed on the clay tablets. A group of gifted linguists worked during the next two decades to unlock the secrets of cuneiform writing and to decode the ancient language of Akkadian, in which most of the tablets were written. Finally, in 1872, a young assistant curator named George Smith came upon the Gilgamesh epic as he worked his way through the myriad of tablets and fragments in the British Museum&#x2019;s collection. The epic aroused intense interest and controversy from the moment Smith began to translate it, as his readers realized that this distant text had much to tell them about a work at the heart of Western culture: the Bible. Smith found that Gilgamesh&#x2019;s ancestor Uta-napishtim was an early version of Noah, and his tale of the Flood broadly agreed with the biblical account but differed in some significant details.<br>Within days of this discovery, sermons and newspaper editorials began to engage in sharp debate: What did the Babylonian version prove, the truth of biblical history or its falsity? As the New York Times noted in a front-page article, &#x201c;For the present the orthodox people are in great delight, and are very much prepossessed by the corroboration which it affords to Biblical history. It is possible, however, as has been pointed out, that the Chaldean inscription, if genuine, may be regarded as a confirmation of the statement that there are various traditions of the deluge apart from the Biblical one, which is perhaps legendary like the rest.&#x201d; Smith&#x2019;s scholarly detective work brought the ancient epic squarely into the middle of the heated Victorian controversy over creation and evolution, religion and science, a debate that continues today.<br>Some further detective work is required today, though, to get the full benefit of the epic&#x2019;s rich history. Layard, Rassam, and Smith wrote voluminous books about their adventures, but they rarely told the whole story in print: as proper Victorians, they could be irritatingly discreet just when they approached the heart of the conflicts in which they were involved, and like all memoirists they shaped their tale for public ends. To get a three-dimensional picture, it is necessary to supplement their books with other sources. Fortunately, the British Museum and the British Library have preserved many of their private letters and journals, which are fresh, lively, and often surprisingly candid. Most of these papers have been buried for a century in these archives, never published or even discussed. These materials give a vivid picture of what was going on behind the scenes, and at important points they correct received ideas that are flat-out wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Archival research sometimes becomes almost its own branch of urban archaeology. Whereas the British Library&#x2019;s holdings have been comprehensively catalogued and cross-indexed, the British Museum&#x2019;s departments have much more informal archives, consisting of yellowing file folders, masses of correspondence going back two hundred years, and stacks of old account books. The museum&#x2019;s curators have the most precise knowledge of every artistic artifact in their care, but departmental records can be stored in rather haphazard ways. In a small field like Assyriology, everyone knows their discipline&#x2019;s history in a general way, but it is rarely studied in depth. Documents concerning the early days of archaeology are scattered, and finding key sources can be a chancy affair, following an uncertain trail from one informant to another.<br>I had this experience in talking with two curators in the British Museum&#x2019;s Department of Near Eastern Antiquities, Susan Collins and Irving Finkel. They generously took time away from their curatorial work on several occasions to supply me with cuneiform tablets, old letters, and Victorian newspaper clippings, yet I drew a blank when I asked for sources on a crucial episode involving Hormuzd Rassam. He had gone on to a distinguished career after discovering Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s palace but late in life had become embroiled in disputes with the museum&#x2019;s rising young Egyptologist, E. A. Wallis Budge. The conflict had culminated in a disastrous lawsuit that Rassam filed against Budge in 1893, and I was sure that the museum must have records of this suit. Dr. Collins was able to find some newspaper reports and a few unrelated letters from Budge, but nothing more. Dr. Finkel, too, was at a loss, but just as I was about to leave, some stray remark prompted him to pause, thoughtfully stroking his bushy white beard. There was, he suggested, another archivist I could talk to, at the museum&#x2019;s little-visited Central Archive, and perhaps I might find something there.<br>So I made my way to the Central Archive, which is reached, oddly, through an unmarked door at the back of the British Museum gift shop. Once through that door, I walked through a series of darkened, echoing rooms filled with empty bookshelves (the books having been transferred to the recently constructed British Library), then came to a warren of small offices, among which is the Central Archive. Of the seven days of the week, it is open to the public for five hours on Tuesdays. In the archive I found a trove of information: an entire folio scrapbook labeled &#x201c;Rassam v. Budge, 1893.&#x201d; It contained extensive records of the pivotal lawsuit, including the pleadings and the actual transcript of the judge&#x2019;s detailed summation to the jury. Turning the musty pages of this volume, I experienced the archaeologist&#x2019;s sense of discovery as a long-lost drama unfolded, day by day, in the summer of 1893.<br>Archaeologists work their way down through time, from the present-day surface back through layer after layer of the ever more distant past. This book proceeds in the same way into &#x201c;the dark backward and abysm of time,&#x201d; in Prospero&#x2019;s phrase. The following chapters will go from what is known to what is unknown, from what is near in space and time to what is far away. The account begins with the lives of the two people who played decisive roles in the epic&#x2019;s modern recovery: George Smith, who found the epic in the British Museum only to lose his life in Syria a few years later; and Hormuzd Rassam, discoverer of Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s palace, whose major contributions to archaeology were long suppressed by his English rivals. Starting in the Victorian period, we will then work down in time to explore the ancient era of the tablets&#x2019; burial in the burning ruins of Ashurbanipal&#x2019;s palaces in Nineveh; to examine the mature epic and the early cycle of songs from which it grew; and, finally, to reach Gilgamesh himself at the threshold of history nearly five thousand years ago, architect of Uruk&#x2019;s independence and builder of its magnificent wall.<br>This journey into antiquity has parallels in the ancient text itself, when Gilgamesh leaves his city in search of the secret of eternal life, making the dangerous journey to find his ancestor, &#x201c;Uta-napishtim the Faraway.&#x201d; Journeys ideally end with a return home&#x2014;in this case, back to the present&#x2014;and the epilogue of this book will look at Gilgamesh&#x2019;s renewed life in the present. It has come to figure in the literary work and the political musings of figures as disparate as Philip Roth and Saddam Hussein, and even as a point of reference in the first and second Gulf Wars. The most ancient masterpiece of world literature has become bound up with the most current of events today.&nbsp;Copyright � 2006 by David Damrosch.

Written just before World War I, it articulates Tolstoy's famous dictum that it is morally superior to suffer violence than to do violence&#x2014;a philosophy that has inspired Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and countless others. <br>Famed for such popular novels as <i>War and Peace </i>and<i> Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy experienced a religious crisis at the age of fifty. Thenceforth he devoted himself to promoting the transformation of society, writing stories, essays, and books advocating the pursuit of an inner moral revolution. In the preface to this work, Tolstoy declares, "The only reason why I am writing this is because, knowing the one means of salvation for Christian humanity, from its physical corruption as well as from the moral corruption in which it is sunk, I, who am on the edge of the grave, cannot be silent." A century later, Tolstoy's powerful plea for nonviolence continues to resonate.</p><p>Nikolai Tolstoy is a highly recognized and acclaimed historian and biographer.

The victorious allied powers wanted to annex the Ottoman territories and German colonies they had occupied; Woodrow Wilson and a groundswell of anti-imperialist activism stood in their way. France, Belgium, Japan and the British dominions reluctantly agreed to an Anglo-American proposal to hold and administer those allied conquests under "mandate" from the new League of Nations. In the end, fourteen mandated territories were set up across the Middle East, Africa and the Pacific. Against all odds, these disparate and far-flung territories became the site and the vehicle of global transformation.<br><br>In this masterful history of the mandates system, Susan Pedersen illuminates the role the League of Nations played in creating the modern world. Tracing the system from its creation in 1920 until its demise in 1939, Pedersen examines its workings from the realm of international diplomacy; the viewpoints of the League's experts and officials; and the arena of local struggles within the territories themselves. Featuring a cast of larger-than-life figures, including Lord Lugard, King Faisal, Chaim Weizmann and Ralph Bunche, the narrative sweeps across the globe-from windswept scrublands along the Orange River to famine-blighted hilltops in Rwanda to Damascus under French bombardment-but always returns to Switzerland and the sometimes vicious battles over ideas of civilization, independence, economic relations, and sovereignty in the Geneva headquarters. As Pedersen shows, although the architects and officials of the mandates system always sought to uphold imperial authority, colonial nationalists, German revisionists, African-American intellectuals and others were able to use the platform Geneva offered to challenge their claims. Amid this cacophony, imperial statesmen began exploring new means - client states, economic concessions - of securing Western hegemony. In the end, the mandate system helped to create the world in which we now live.<br><br>A riveting work of global history, <em>The Guardians</em> enables us to look back at the League with new eyes, and in doing so, appreciate how complex, multivalent, and consequential this first great experiment in internationalism really was.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan Pedersen </strong>is Professor and James P.

This unique book provides a systematic framework for negotiating ruptures and strains in the therapeutic alliance and transforming them into therapeutic breakthroughs. Cutting-edge developments in psychoanalysis and other modalities are synthesized with original research and clinical wisdom gleaned from years of work in the field. The result is a practical and highly sophisticated guide that spells out clear principles of intervention while at the same time inspiring therapists toward greater creativity. <br></p><p>&#34;This book is an unparalleled achievement that transcends many of the usual dichotomies in the field. Structured as a treatment manual, the book elaborates detailed interventions and techniques, but it is also personal and experiential, emphasizing procedural knowledge, self-awareness, and reflection-in-action. It is among the few comprehensive texts that truly integrates ongoing empirical research with cutting-edge developments in clinical psychoanalysis, as well as elements of other therapeutic modalities. It outlines broad theoretical and philosophical principles, yet at the same time provides clear-cut intervention strategies, illustrated with lively and meaningful clinical material. On top of all this it is clearly and engagingly written, well organized, and even includes a creative chapter on the largely unexamined area of training issues and supervision. This book will be used both as a classroom text and as a sourcebook for working clinicians, researchers, and theorists.&#34; Lewis Aron, PhD, Director, Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, New York UniversityJeremy D.

How can clinicians learn to pick up on interpersonal nuance, using their intuition to bridge the gap between theory and practice? Drawing from 30 years of clinical experience, Marks-Tarlow explores the central&#x2015; yet neglected&#x2015;topic of intuition in psychotherapy, sharing clinical insights and intuitions that can help transform traumatized brains into healthy minds.<br><br> Bridging art and science, <em>Clinical Intuition in Psychotherapy</em> is grounded in interpersonal neurobiology, and filled with rich case vignettes, personal stories, and original artwork. In the early chapters of the book, Marks-Tarlow defines clinical intuition as a right-brain, fully embodied mode of perceiving, relating, and responding to the ongoing flows and changing dynamics of psychotherapy. She examines how the body &#x201c;has a mind of its own&#x201d; in the form of implicit processes, uncovering the implicit roots of clinical intuition within human empathy and emphasizing the importance of play to clinical intuition.</p><p>Encouraging therapists to bring their own unique senses of humor to clinical practice, she explains how the creative neural powers of playfulness, embedded within sensitive clinical dialogs, can move clients&#x2019; lives toward lasting positive affective growth.<br><br> Later chapters explore the play of imagination within clinical intuition, where imagery and metaphor can lead to deeper insight about underlying emotions and relational truths than words alone; the developmental foundations for intuition; and clinical intuition as a vehicle for developing and expressing wisdom. At the close of each chapter, reflective exercises help the reader personally integrate the concepts.<br><br> Part of the Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology, this wonderful guidebook will help clinicians harness the power of spontaneous intuitive thinking to transform their therapeutic practices.</p></p><p>Terry Marks-Tarlow, PhD, is a clinical psychologist in private practice in Santa Monica, California.

Geoffrey Ingham argues that mainstream economics and sociology fail to grasp the specific nature of money. It is seen either as a &#x2018;neutral veil&#x2019; over the operation of the &#x2018;real&#x2019; economy or its existence is simply taken for granted.<br> <p>Defining money as a socially and politically constructed &#x2018;promise to pay&#x2019;, Ingham applies this approach to a range of important historical and analytical questions. The origins of money, the &#x2018;cashless&#x2019; monetary systems of the ancient Near Eastern empires, the pre-capitalist coinage of Greece and Rome and the emergence of capitalist credit-money are all given new interpretations. In contrast to the conventional focus on production and property relations, ir is argued that capitalism&#x2019;s distinctiveness is to be found in the social structure � comprising complex linkages between firms, banks and states � by which private debts are routinely &#x2018;monetized&#x2019;. Monetary &#x2018;disorders&#x2019; � inflation, deflation, the collaspe of currencies � are the result of disruptions of, or the inability to sustain, these credit�debt relations. Finally, this concept of money is used to clarify confusion in the recent debates on the emergence of new forms and spaces of money � such as global electronic money, local exchange trading schemes and the euro.</p>Faculty of Social and Political Science, University of Cambridge</p><h2>The Real Analysis Lifesaver: All the Tools You Need to Understand Proofs (Princeton Lifesaver Study Guides)</h2><p><p><b>The essential "lifesaver" that every student of real analysis needs</b></p><p>Real analysis is difficult.

P. Pirone, who authored the first five editions and co authored the sixth, has been revised to reflect the enormous amount of new information available since the last edition, including the latest techniques in selecting, planting, and protecting trees. The authors explain how to evaluate the site (the soil, drainage, and exposure), how to select the right tree for that location, and how to prune, fertilize, and spray for pests. There is an extensive section on the diagnosis and control of tree pests and diseases, and on problems such as construction damage, gas injury, sunscald, leaf scorch, and air pollution. While the general structure of the sixth edition has been retained, there are several topics notably hazardous trees and coping with tree pests and diseases that have received greater attention than in previous versions of the book. The second half of the book comprises a systematic listing of the major landscape trees found in North America, describing the specific pests and diseases that attack each species. <br> Well organized, clearly written, and beautifully illustrated with many new photographs, <em>Pirone's Tree Maintenance</em> is an encyclopedic resource, the first place to turn for information on dogwoods and elms, magnolias and redwoods, or any other tree growing in North America.

Now, in <em>The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel</em>, William Goldbloom Bloch takes readers on a fascinating tour of the mathematical ideas hidden within one of the classic works of modern literature.<br> <br> Written in the vein of Douglas R. Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>G�del, Escher, Bach</em>, this original and imaginative book sheds light on one of Borges' most complex, richly layered works. Bloch begins each chapter with a mathematical idea--combinatorics, topology, geometry, information theory--followed by examples and illustrations that put flesh on the theoretical bones. In this way, he provides many fascinating insights into <em>Borges' Library</em>. He explains, for instance, a straightforward way to calculate how many books are in the Library--an easily notated but literally unimaginable number--and also shows that, if each book were the size of a grain of sand, the entire universe could only hold a fraction of the books in the Library. Indeed, if each book were the size of a proton, our universe would still not be big enough to hold anywhere near all the books.<br> <br> Given Borges' well-known affection for mathematics, this exploration of the story through the eyes of a humanistic mathematician makes a unique and important contribution to the body of Borgesian criticism. Bloch not only illuminates one of the great short stories of modern literature but also exposes the reader--including those more inclined to the literary world--to many intriguing and entrancing mathematical ideas.<br></p><p><br><strong>William Goldbloom Bloch</strong> is Professor of Mathematics at Wheaton College.<br><br>"Mr. Bloch, professor of mathematics at Wheaton College, has woven an elegant, ingenious, scholarly interpretation of Borges's text that contradicts the disingenuous 'unimaginable' of his title."--<em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"For the reader of Borges, some of Bloch's observations may offer a useful new way of engaging with the themes of the fiction." -- <em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"You need no advanced mathematics to understand 'The Library of Babel' but chances are good that if you like the story, you'll enjoy Professor Bloch's excursions." -- <em>Mathematical Association of America Review</em><p></p><br>"Given Borges' well-known affection for mathematics, this exploration of the story through the eyes of a humanistic mathematician makes a unique and important contribution to the body of Borgesian criticism.

Viseltear Prize, American Public Health Association</b><br><br> With an emphasis on the American West, <i>Eugenic Nation</i> explores the long and unsettled history of eugenics in the United States. This expanded second edition includes shocking details demonstrating that eugenics continues to inform institutional and reproductive injustice. Alexandra Minna Stern draws on recently uncovered historical records to reveal patterns of racial bias in California&#x2019;s sterilization program and documents compelling individual experiences. With the addition of radically new and relevant research, this edition connects the eugenic past to the genomic present with attention to the ethical and social implications of emerging genetic technologies.</p><p><p><i><b>Praise for Previous Edition:</b></i><br><br> "At long last, a book about eugenics in California, which sterilized more people than any other state.&nbsp;<i>Eugenic Nation</i>&nbsp;reveals what fueled the movement, including Hispanic immigration, fear of disease, and environmental preservation.

Why don't we just reproduce, then exit fast, like salmon? Could aging just be one big evolutionary accident? Is senescence, the gradual falling apart of our bodies, at least partially avoidable? Can we extend the healthy lifespan and reduce the lingering, debilitating effects of senescence? <br><br>In this book, investigative health journalist Judy Foreman suggests that we actually can, and the key element is exercise, through its myriad effects on dozens of molecules in the brain, the muscles, and other organs. It's no secret, of course, that exercise is good for you and that exercise can extend longevity. What Foreman uncovers through extensive research into evolutionary biology, exercise physiology, and the new field of geroscience is exactly why exercise is so powerful - the mechanisms now being discovered that account for the vast and varied effects of exercise all over the body. Though Foreman also delves into pills designed to combat aging and so-called exercise "mimetics," or pills that purport to produce the effects of exercise without the sweat, her resounding conclusion is that exercise itself is by far the most effective, and safest, strategy for promoting a long, healthy life. In addition to providing a fascinating look at the science of exercise's effects on the body, Foreman also provides answers to the most commonly asked practical questions about exercise.<br></p><p><br>Judy Foreman is a nationally syndicated health columnist who has won more than 50 journalism awards and whose columns have appeared regularly in the<em> Boston Globe</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Dallas Morning News</em>, <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, and other national and international outlets.

Although the occasional newspaper headline mentions authoritarian rule, corruption, genocide, devastating illnesses, or civil war in Africa, the collective American consciousness still carries strong mental images of Africa that are reflected in advertising, movies, amusement parks, cartoons, and manyother corners of society. Few think to question these perceptions or how they came to be so deeply lodged in American minds. </p> <p><em>Mistaking Africa</em> looks at the historical evolution of this mind-set and examines the role that popular media plays in its creation. The authors address the most prevalent myths and preconceptions and demonstrate how these prevent a true understanding of the enormously diverse peoples and cultures of Africa.Updated throughout, the fourth edition covers the entire continent (North and sub-Saharan Africa) and provides new analysis of topics such as social media and the Internet, the Ebola crisis, celebrity aid, and the Arab Spring. </p> <p><em>Mistaking Africa</em> is an important book for African studies courses and for anyone interested in unraveling American misperceptions about the continent.</p></p><p><p>Curtis Keim is professor emeritus of history at Moravian College.

(The Bowlby Centre Monograph Series)</h2><p>This outstanding book is an important collection of papers from the 2013 John Bowlby Memorial Conference by accomplished clinicians from different modalities who share their experience of working with people with different kinds of addiction. The papers bring together an in-depth understanding that addictions are a response to, and hold the pain of, broken attachments and are best treated within healthy interpersonal relationships. For a long time the person with an addiction has been seen as the problem with society being able to live in denial of the causes. These papers open up innovative and effective ways of working with people troubled by addiction from an attachment-informed perspective.Contributors: Cara Crossan, Richard Gill, Lynn Greenwood, Bob Johnson, Liz Karter, Edward Khantzian, Arlene Vetere, Kate White, Jason Wright</p><p>Richard Gill"This outstanding book is an important collection of essays by an array of gifted clinicians addressing the exciting and crucial impact that attachment theory is having on the understanding of addictive disorders and its treatment. Edward J. Khantzian&#x2019;s article is, in itself, worth the price of the book as he provides a lucid and comprehensive review of his paradigm shifting Self-Medication Hypothesis, which has evolved into an even more elegant explanation of addiction as an affect regulation disorder. Not only does Dr Khanztian offer a more satisfying and accurate description of the intrapsychic and interpersonal dynamics of addictions, he provides a much-needed replacement of the archaic and pejorative perspective of drive theory&#x2019;s view of addiction as pleasure seeking with a more compassionate and accurate model reflecting the comprehensive understanding of attachment as a primary drive. He concludes his remarks by helping the reader understand how the absence of secure attachment is a risk factor for affect dysregulation in children and subsequently, addiction in adults." (Phillip J. Flores)<br><br>"This book comprises a set of chapters by highly experienced clinicians and researchers, who have employed and developed attachment theory in a variety of innovative and applicable ways. The book serves as an excellent resource and will stimulate others to take their ideas further. The excellent chapter by Arlene Vetere is an example of the scope and importance of this book. Arlene Vetere has delivered clinical interventions and training regarding problems of alcohol and substance dependency for over twenty years. In this paper, her depth of experience, sophisticated and creative clinical formulation, and sensitive ways of intervening shine through. She offers a highly effective form of intervention, which combines concepts from attachment theory, systemic therapy, and narrative theory. The combination of these results in an approach that is greater than the sum of the parts, not least in that it offers a compassionate approach that employs these perspectives in a reflective and non-judgemental manner. The value of the approach is illuminated through the poignant case examples that are employed to illustrate the approach. These also offer a guide and inspiration for clinicians and researchers wishing to pursue Arlene&#x2019;s approach."

Gilles Emery OP provides an explanation of the main questions in Thomas&#39;s treatise on the Trinity in his major work, the Summa Theologiae. His presentation clarifies the key ideas through which Thomas accounts for the nature of Trinitarian monotheism. Emery focuses on the personal relations of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, both in their eternal communion and in their creative and saving action. By highlighting the thought of one of the greatest defenders of the doctrine of the Trinity, he enables people to grasp the classical Christian understanding of God.</p><p>Gilles Emery is Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.

What if you had within you the ability to heal from any condition?</i></p><p>This fascinating book by <b>Barbara Wren</b> shatters many of the myths that currently exist regarding health and illness, and presents a vision of the human body and healing that is both practical and inspirational. In essence, no matter what ailment you&#x2019;re dealing with, you have the potential to heal yourself; and if you already enjoy great health, you can illuminate your consciousness in ways beyond your imagining. Whatever your current situation is, you can begin to feel a true connection to who you really are, as well as understand your ability to create your own reality.</p><p>Your human potential is far greater than you can possibly imagine and is intrinsically linked to what is unfolding within you at a cellular level. Each and every one of the trillions of cells within your amazing body has the potential to hold and utilize light in the form of bio photons, subatomic particles of light. When a cell is illuminated, the DNA within that cell is also illuminated, giving you access to the universal wisdom that is held within its matrix. By matching your microcosm (the cell) with the macrocosm (the universal energies), you can begin to unlock your true nature and realize your potential for greatness.</p></p><p><p><b>Barbara Wren</b> has been teaching and lecturing for the past 27 years, showing people a different approach to wellness through nutrition and healing techniques.

After Captain John Smith establishes trade with the Native Americans. After Pocahontas befriends the colonists. After early settlers both thrive and die in this new world . . . a girl is born. Virginia.<br><br>Virginia Laydon, an infant at the end of <i>Blood on the River</i>, has now grown up in a colony that is teetering dangerously on the precipice of conflict with the native Algonquins. Virginia has the gift, or the curse, of the knowing-an ability that could help save the colony, and is equally likely to land her at the burning stake as an accused witch. <br><br>Virginia struggles to make sense of her own inner world against the backdrop of pivotal years in the Jamestown colony. The first representative government is established, the first enslaved Africans arrive, and the self-righteousness of the colony's leaders angers the Algonquin. <br><br>When Virginia's mother first learns of her gift, she is terrified. <i>Kill it</i>, her mother says, <i>or they will kill you</i>. When accusations and danger threaten, Virginia learns that she is on her own; her mother must protect her young sisters rather than stand up for her.

The North Star state boasts the highest number of anglers per capita in the nation and the most fishing lakes. Minnesota is abundant in knowledge about how to catch game fish, but there is little information on the lore and natural history of such prized species as the walleye and largemouth bass, not to mention lesser-known varieties such as the brook stickleback and pirate perch. From trophies to bait, <i>The Great Minnesota Fish Book</i> tells stories of these aquatic species in rich, colorful detail. <br><br><i> The Great Minnesota Fish Book</i> pairs engaging and revealing stories about the history, habitat, and culture of more than one hundred species with strikingly lifelike depictions by world-renowned fish illustrator Joseph R. Tomelleri. Providing defining features for easy identification, descriptions of habitat, growth patterns, and behavior, as well as historical anecdotes, Dickson makes a convincing case for the appreciation of all fish and their important place within Minnesota&#x2019;s aquatic ecosystems. Where else can you learn about the American eel, a fish that lives throughout southern Minnesota yet spawns in the Caribbean Sea? Or the Johnny darter, which reproduces upside down? Or the monstrous lake sturgeon that can reach more than 300 pounds and swims in waters from Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River? Nowhere, until now. Tom Dickson takes us on a lively tour of Minnesota fish&#x2014;the good, the bad, and the ugly. <br><br>An elegant full-color work for everyone from the passionate angler to the up-north cabin dweller, T<i>he Great Minnesota Fish Book </i>conveys the love and fascination&#x2014;and in the case of eelpout, the disdain&#x2014;that people have for the fishes of our home state.&nbsp;Tom Dickson is the author of The Great Minnesota Fish Book (Minnesota, 2008) and has written for National Wildlife, Sporting Classics, and Fly Fisherman.

Both plays abound in colorful characters, ingenious plotting, biting wit, and sharp insight into human nature.<br>In <i>Volpone</i> (1605), a crafty rich man attempts to augment his wealth by feigning a mortal illness. His wealthy neighbors, spying the opportunity for an inheritance, vie with each other in courting the &#x201c;dying&#x201d; man&#x2019;s favor. <i>The Alchemist</i> (1610) comprises a likewise avaricious cast, headed by a butler and prostitute who join forces with a swindler claiming to possess the philosopher's stone. The trio hosts a parade of eager victims whose hypocrisy and greed place them on a moral footing similar to that of the tricksters. Both plays offer sparkling examples of their author's novel approach to satire and his distinctive blend of savagery, humor, moralism, and a powerful sense of the absurd.</p><p></p><h2>Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village</h2><p>Woven from the words of the inhabitants of a small Suffolk village in the 1960s,<i> Akenfield</i> is a masterpiece&nbsp;of twentieth-century English literature, a scrupulously observed and deeply affecting portrait of a place and people and a now vanished way of life. Ronald Blythe&#x2019;s wonderful book raises enduring questions about the relations between memory and modernity, nature and human nature, silence and speech.</p><p><p><b>Ronald Blythe</b> was born in 1922 in Suffolk, England, where his family has lived for centuries. He is the author of some thirty books including works of fiction, criticism, memoir, and social history, and has served as editor for a number of novels, poetry anthologies, and diaries. For the past twenty years he has written a weekly column for the <i>Church Times</i> about daily life in the Suffolk village of Wormingford, where he lives. He is the president of the John Clare Society and in 2006 received a lifetime acheivement award from the Royal Society of Literature.<br><br> <b>Matt Weiland</b> is a vice president and senior editor at W.W. Norton &amp; Company. A former editor at <i>Granta</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Paris Review</i>, he is also the co-editor, with Sean Wilsey, of S<i>tate by State: A Panoramic Portrait of America</i>. His writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, and <i>The Nation</i>, and he contributed the introduction to the NYRB Classics edition of <i>Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States</i> by George R. Stewart.</p>"Ronald Blythe conducted the fifty-odd oral histories that make up his portrait of a (renamed) village in rural Suffolk with an exceptionally sharp eye for poignant situations and an equally fine ear for telling phrases. Every one of his interviews is a compact drama of identity&#x2014;often riveting in itself, and always contributing to an idea of community that is at once coherent and varied." &#x2014;Andrew Motion, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ronald Blythe lovingly draws apart the curtains of legend and landscape, revealing the inner, almost clandestine, spirit of the village behind. His book consists of a series of direct-speech monologues, delivered by forty-nine Suffolk residents, and interpretatively linked by the author. The effect is one of astonishing immediacy: it is as if those country people have looked up for a moment from their plow, lawnmower or kitchen sink, and are talking directly (and disturbingly frankly) to the reader. This is a brilliant and extraordinary book which raises disquieting second thoughts when the poetry has faded&#x2014;as Mr. Blythe says, it is like a &#x2018;strange journey through a familiar land.&#x2019;&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Jan Morris, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> &#x201c;A hundred years from now, anyone wanting to know how things were on the land will turn more profitably to <i>Akenfield</i> than to a sheaf of anaemically professional social surveys.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2014;The Guardian<br></i><br> &#x201c;For all its quiet and subtlety, <i>Akenfield</i> documents the disappearance of an entire mode of civilization.

By 1940, electric lights, dining rooms, and bathrooms were the norm as the traditional working-class home was fast becoming modern&#x2014;a fact largely missing from the story of domestic innovation and improvement in twentieth-century America, where such benefits seem to count primarily among the upper classes and the post&#x2013;World War II denizens of suburbia. Examining the physical evidence of America&#x2019;s working-class houses, Thomas C. Hubka revises our understanding of how widespread domestic improvement transformed the lives of Americans in the modern era. His work, focused on the broad central portion of the housing population, recalibrates longstanding ideas about the nature and development of the &#x201c;middle class&#x201d; and its new measure of improvement, &#x201c;standards of living.&#x201d;</p><p>In <i>How the Working-Class Home Became Modern, 1900&#x2013;1940</i>, Hubka analyzes a period when millions of average Americans saw accelerated improvement in their housing and domestic conditions. These improvements were intertwined with the acquisition of entirely new mechanical conveniences, new types of rooms and patterns of domestic life, and such innovations&#x2014;from public utilities and kitchen appliances to remodeled and multi-unit housing&#x2014;are at the center of the story Hubka tells. It is a narrative, amply illustrated and finely detailed, that traces changes in household hygiene, sociability, and privacy practices that launched large portions of the working classes into the middle class&#x2014;and that, in Hubka&#x2019;s telling, reconfigures and enriches the standard account of the domestic transformation of the American home.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Thomas C. Hubka is professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee and author of <i>Big House, Little House, Back House, Barn: The Connected Farm Buildings of New England</i>; <i>Resplendent Synagogue: Architecture and Worship in an Eighteenth-Century Polish Community</i>; and <i>Houses without Names: Architectural Nomenclature and the Classification of America&#x2019;s Common Houses</i>.</p></p><h2>99% Perspiration: A Frazz Collection</h2><p>Here's a strip to savor, doubly immersed in squeaky cleanliness and a knowing grasp of second graders' cool universe." &#x2014;Mike Durrett, Humor Today Frazz is fun. Frazz is cool. Frazz is . . . a hit! Take one successful and secure songwriter, put him on the steering end of a janitor's broom, and drop him into the world of elementary education. And with that, if Jef Mallett's calling the creative shots, you have the makings of one of the most flourishing new comic strips to come along in years. Frazz follows the life and loves of one Edwin Frazier, aka "Frazz," as he writes more best-selling lyrics, ponders the world's greatest literature and deepest mysteries with an 8-year-old genius, and interacts with the menagerie of other faculty and staff members. What results is a wild mix of witty observations and outright slapstick that amuses while causing you to see the world in a new light. 99 Percent Perspiration is the second collection of this very popular strip that appears in more than 150 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, and Chicago Tribune. Frazz was nominated in 2004 as one of the best comic strips of the year by the National Cartoonists Society.

Here he creates a psychopathic Russian zillionaire bent on killing random people during the festival in order to get his ex-wife back. How serial murder is to accomplish this is murky, and Coelho is too busy disdainfully telling (not showing) what film and fashion worlds are like, according to him, to make his (too) many characters, jaded celebrities, and hopeful wannabes real. So what suspense one feels as to who will live or die is largely created by Paul Boehmer&#39;s sympathetic narration. Boehmer occasionally loses focus in the middle of a sentence, but otherwise earnestly labors to create some recognizable people in this uncomfortable welter of nihilism and celebrity dirt.

Bringing together a variety of previously uncollected stories, columns, reviews, introductions, and interviews, this book finds him approaching the dynamics of his chosen profession with cynical aplomb, deflating pretensions and tearing down idols armed with only a typewriter and a bottle of beer. Beginning with the title piece&#x2015;a serious manifesto disguised as off-handed remarks en route to the racetrack&#x2015;<em>The Mathematics of the Breath and the Way </em>runs through numerous tales following the author&#x2019;s adventures at poetry readings, parties, film sets, and bars, and also features an unprecedented gathering of Bukowski&#x2019;s singular literary criticism. From classic authors like Hemingway to underground legends like d.a. levy to his own stable of obscure favorites, Bukowski uses each occasion to expound on the larger issues around literary production. The book closes with a handful of interviews in which he discusses his writing practices and his influences, making this a perfect guide to the man behind the myth and the disciplined artist behind the boozing brawler.</p></p><p><p>Born in Andernach, Germany, and raised in Los Angeles, <strong>Charles Bukowski</strong> published his first short story when he was twenty-four and began writing poetry at the age of thirty-five. His first book of poetry was published in 1959; he would eventually publish more than forty-five books of poetry and prose. He died of leukemia in San Pedro, California on March 9, 1994.<br><br><strong>David Stephen Calonne</strong> is the author of several books and has edited four previous collections of the uncollected work of Charles Bukowski for City Lights: <em>Portions from a Wine-Stained Notebook</em>, <em>Absence of the Hero</em>, <em>More Notes of a Dirty Old Man</em>, and <em>The Bell Tolls for No One</em>.</p><p>"Upon the Mathematics of the Breath and the Way"<br><br>"More Notes of a Dirty Old Man," December 20, 1970<br><br>"The Deliberate Mashing of the Sun" (d.a. levy tribute)<br><br>*** <br><br><strong>"Upon the Mathematics of the Breath and the Way"</strong><br><br>I was going to begin this with a little rundown on the female but since the smoke on the local battlefront has cleared a bit I will relent, but there are 50,000 men in this nation who must sleep on their bellies for fear of losing their parts to women with wild-glazed eyes and knives. Brothers and sisters, I am 52 and there is a trail of females behind me, enough for 5 men's lives. Some of the ladies have claimed that I have betrayed them for drink; well, I'd like to see any man stick his pecker into a fifth of whiskey. Of course, you can get your tongue in there but the bottle doesn't respond. Well, haha among the trumpets, let's get back to the word.<br><br>The word. I'm on my way to the track, opening day at Hollywood Park, but I'll tell you about the word. To get the word down proper, that takes courage, seeing the form, living the life, and getting it into the line. Hemingway takes his critical blows now from people who can't write. There are hundreds of thousands of people who think they can write. They are the critics, the bellyachers and the mockers. To point to a good writer and call him a hunk of shit helps satisfy their loss as creators, and the better a man gets the more he is envied and, in turn, hated. You ought to hear them razz and demean Pincay and Shoemaker, two of the greatest jocks ever to steer a horse. There's a little man outside our local tracks who sells newspapers and he says, "Get your paper, get your info on Shoemaker the Faker." Here he is calling a man who has ridden more winners than any other jock alive (and he's still riding and riding well) and here's this newspaper guy selling papers for a dime and calling the Shoe a fraud. The Shoe is a millionaire, not that that's important, but he did get it with his talent and he could buy this guy's newspapers, all of them, for the rest of this guy's life and into a half dozen eternities. Hemingway, too, gets the sneers from the newspaper boys and girls of writing. They didn't like his exit. I thought his exit was quite fine. He created his own mercy killing. And he created some writing. Some of it depended too much on style but it was a style he broke through with; a style that ruined thousands of writers who attempted to use any portion of it. Once a style is evolved it is thought of as a simple thing, but style not only evolves through a method, it evolves through feeling, it is like laying a brush to canvas in a certain way and if you're not living along the path of power and flow, style vanishes. Hemingway's style did tend to vanish toward the end, progressively, but that's because he let down his guard and let people do things to him. But he gave us more than plenty. There is a minor poet I know who came over the other night. He is a learned man, and clever, he lets the ladies support him so you know he's good at something. He is a very powerful figure of a man growing soft around the edges, looks quite literary and carries these black notebooks around with him and he reads to you from them. This boy told me the other night, "Bukowski, I can write like you but you can't write like me." I didn't answer him because he needs his self-glory, but really, he only thinks he can write like me. Genius could be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way, or even to say a simple thing in a simpler way. Oh, by the way, if you want to get one angle on a minor writer, it is one who throws a party or gets one thrown for him when his book comes out.</p> <p>Hemingway studied the bullfights for form and meaning and courage and failure and the way. I go to boxing matches and attend horse races for the same reason. There is a feeling at the wrists and the shoulders and the temples. There is a manner of watching and recording that grows into the line and the form and the act and the fact and the flower, and the dog walking and the dirty panties under the bed, and the sound of the typewriter as you're sitting there, that's the big sound, the biggest sound in the world, when you're getting it down in your way, the right way, and no beautiful woman counts before it and nothing that you could paint or sculpt counts before it; it is the final art, this writing down of the word, and the reason for valor is all there, it is the finest gamble ever arranged and not many win.<br><br>Somebody asked me, "Bukowski, if you taught a course in writing what would you ask them to do?" I answered, "I'd send them all to the racetrack and force them to bet $5 on each race." This ass thought I was joking. The human race is very good at treachery and cheating and modifying a position. What people who want to be writers need is to be put in an area that they cannot maneuver out of by weak and dirty play. This is why groups of people at parties are so disgusting: all their envy and smallness and trickery surfaces. If you want to find out who your friends are you can do two things: invite them to a party or go to jail. You will soon find that you don't have any friends.<br><br>If you think I am wandering here, hold your tits or your balls or hold somebody else's. Everything fits here.<br><br>And since I must presume (I haven't seen any of it) that I am being honored and criticized in this issue I should say something about the little magazines, although I might have said some of it elsewhere? -at least over a row of beer bottles. Little magazines are useless perpetuators of useless talent. Back in the 20's and 30's there was not an abundance of littles. A little magazine was an event, not a calamity. One could trace the names from the littles and up through literary history; I mean, they began there and they went up, they became. They became books, novels, things. Now most little magazine people begin little and remain little. There are always exceptions. For instance, I remember first reading Truman Capote in a little named Decade, and I thought here is a man with some briskness, style and fairly original energy. But basically, like it or not, the large slick magazines print a much higher level of work than the littles&#x2015;and most especially in prose. Every jackass in America pumps out countless and ineffectual poems. And a large number of them are published in the littles. Tra la la, another edition. Give us a grant, see what we are doing! I receive countless little magazines through the mail, unsolicited, un-asked for. I flip through them. Arid vast nothingness. I think that the miracle of our times is that so many people can write down so many words that mean absolutely nothing, but they can do it, and they do it continually and relentlessly. I put out 3 issues of a little, Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns. The material received was so totally inept that the other editor and myself were forced to write most of the poems. He'd write the first half of one poem, then I'd finish it. Then I'd go [do?] the first half of another and he'd finish it. Then we'd sit around and get to the names: "Let's see, whatta we gonna call this cocksucker?"</p> <p>And with the discovery of the mimeo machine everybody became an editor, all with great flair, very little expense and no results at all. Ole was an early exception and I might grant you one or two other exceptions if you corner me with the facts. As per the better printed (non-mimeo) mags one must grant The Wormwood Review (one half hundred issues now) as the outstanding work of our time in that area. Quietly and without weeping or ranting or bitching or quitting or pausing, or without writing braggadocio letters (as most do) about being arrested for driving drunk on a bicycle in Pacific Palisades or corn-holing one of the National Endowment for the Arts editors in a Portland hotel room, Malone has simply gone on and on and compiled an exact and lively talent, issue after issue after issue. Malone lets his issues speak for themselves and remains invisible. You won't find him beating on your door one night with a huge jug of cheap port wine saying, "Hey, I'm Marvin Malone, I printed your poem Catshit in a Bird's Nest in my last issue. I think I'm gonna kick me some ass. Ya got anything for me to fuck around here?"<br><br>A vast grinding lonely hearts club of no-talents, that's what the littles have evolved to, with the editors a worse breed than the writers. If you are a writer seriously interested in creating art instead of a foolishness, then there are, at any moment, a few littles to submit to, where the editing is professional instead of personal. I haven't read the mag that this piece is submitted to but I would suggest, along with Wormwood, as decent arenas: The New York Quarterly, Event, Second Aeon, Joe Dimaggio, Second Coming, The Little Magazine, and Hearse. <br><br>"You're supposed to be a writer," she says, "if you put all the energy into writing that you put into the racetack you'd be great." I think of something Wallace Stevens once said, "Success as a result of industry is a peasant's ideal." Or if he didn't say that he said something close to that. The writing arrives when it wants to. There is nothing you can do about it. You can't squeeze more writing out of the living than is there. Any attempt to do so creates a panic in the soul, diffuses and jars the line. There are stories that Hemingway would get up early in the morning and have all his work done at noon, but though I never met him personally I feel as if Hemingway were an alcoholic who wanted to get his work out of the way so he could get drunk.</p> <p>What I have seen evolve in the littles with most new and fresh talent is an interesting first splash. I think, ah, here's finally one. Maybe we have something now. But the same mechanism begins over and over again. The fresh new talent, having splashed, begins to appear everywhere. He sleeps and bathes with the god damned typewrite and it's running all the time. His name is in every mimeo from Maine to Mexico and the work grows weaker and weaker and weaker and continues to appear. Somebody gets a book out for him (or her) and then they are reading at your local university. They read the 6 or 7 good early poems and all the bad ones. Then you have another little magazine "name" But what has happened is that instead of trying to create the poem they try for as many little mag appearances in as many little magazines as possible. It becomes a contest of publication rather than creation. This diffusion of talent usually occurs among writers in their twenties who don't have enough experience, who don't have enough meat to pick off the bone. You can't write without living and writing all the time is not living. Nor does drinking create a writer or brawling create a writer, and although I've done plenty of both, it's merely a fallacy and a sick romanticism to assume that these actions will make a better writer of one. Of course, there are times when you have to fight and times when you have to drink, but these times are really anti-creative and there's nothing you can do about them.<br><br>Writing, finally, even becomes work especially if you are trying to pay the rent and child support with it. But it is the finest work and the only work, and it's a work that boosts your ability to live and your ability to live pays you back with your ability to create. One feeds the other; it is all very magic. I quit a very dull job at the age of 50 (twas said I had security for life, ah!) and I sat down in front of the typewriter. There's no better way. There are moments of total flaming hell when you feel as if you're going mad; there are moments, days, weeks of no word, no sound, as if it had all vanished. Then it arrives and you sit smoking, pounding, pounding, it rolls and roars. You can get up at noon, you can work until 3 a.m. Some people will bother you. They will not understand what you are trying to do. They will knock on your door and sit in a chair and eat up your hours while giving you nothing. When too many nothing people arrive and keep arriving you must be cruel to them for they are being cruel to you. You must run their asses out on the street. There are some people who pay their way, they bring their own energy and their own light but most of the others are useless both to you and to themselves. It is not being humane to tolerate the dead, it only increases their deadness and they always leave plenty of it with you after they are gone.<br><br>And then, of course, there are the ladies. The ladies would rather go to bed with a poet than anything, even a German police dog, though I knew one lady who took very much delight in claiming she had fucked one President Kennedy. I had no way of knowing. So, if you're a good poet, I'd suggest you learn to be a good lover too, this is a creative act in itself, being a good lover, so learn how, learn how to do it very well because if you're a good poet you're going to get many opportunities, and though it's not like being a rock star, it will come along, so don't waste it like rock stars waste it by going at it rote and half-assed. Let the ladies know that you are really there. Then, of course, they will keep buying your books.</p> <p>And let this be enough advice for a little while. Oh yes, I won $180 opening day, dropped $80 yesterday, so today is the day that counts. It's ten minutes to eleven. First post 2 p.m. I must start lining up my horse genes. There was a guy out there yesterday with a heart machine attached to himself and he was sitting in a wheelchair. He was making bets. Put him in a rest home and he'll be dead overnight. Saw another guy out there, blind. He must have had a better day than I did yesterday. I've got to phone Quagliano and tell him I've finished this article. Now there's a very strange son of a bitch. I don't know how he makes it and he won't tell me. I see him at the boxing matches sitting there with a beer and looking very relaxed. I wonder what he's got going.

Tony Wigram&#39;s practical and comprehensive guide and online content will prove indispensable to students, teachers, therapists and musicians as a book of musical techniques and therapeutic methods. Beginning with an overview of developing, teaching and analysing the skills of improvisation, Wigram describes techniques ranging from warming up to mirroring, rhythmic grounding, containing and holding. With specific sections on piano improvisation, chordal and 2-, 3- and 4- note improvisation are covered, in addition to advanced skills such as frameworking and transitions. Wigram also includes techniques for thematic improvisation, group improvisation and outlines methods for analysing and reporting improvisational processes. Notated examples allow readers to try out techniques and progress as they read, with audio examples on the accompanying online content adding another dimension to the structure and guidance provided for all levels of music student and therapist.</p><p>Tony Wigram was Professor and Head of PhD Studies in Music Therapy at the University of Aalborg, Denmark, Honorary Research Fellow in the Faculty of Music at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and Reader in Music Therapy at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK. He was Associate Editor of the Nordic Journal of Music Therapy, and a former President of both the European Music Therapy Confederation and the World Federation of Music Therapy. He was also Head Music Therapist at the Harper Children&#39;s Service in Hertfordshire, UK, and Research Advisor to Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust.In conclusion, this is an impressive book, essential for its exceptional thoroughness and readability as well as for being the only book of its kind. It will be invaluable as a training manual for professional courses, and may also raise other health professionals' awareness of the complex and scientifically grounded skills deployed by a profession so often obliged to defend its research base against accusations of a lack of scientific rigour from those with too narrow a vision of evidence based medicine. -- British Journal of Music Therapy, John Strange, former Chair of the APMT<br><br>The book's prose is clear and always user friendly. Wigram's approach is also profoundly practical, requiring the reader to work on the methods outlined, moving "backwards as well as forwards" so as to revise, integrate and develop them in ways specific to the needs of particular working contexts. The book is both accessible and profoundly practical. Moreover, whilst written for a music therapy audience, it warrants a much wider readership, including musicians that play in hospitals or in hospices who may not necessarily be formally qualified as music therapists'. -- British Journal of Music Education<br><br>Tony Wigram is an experienced improviser, who has written a book to help others to attain the necessary musical and clinical skills to learn to improvise and to effectively use improvisation in their music therapy sessions. As I begun reading, I felt that Wigram was speaking to my experience. He spoke to and normalized my fears of failure and my inner voice of self-criticism. His intention with this book is to dispel the myth that improvisation is "a gift granted to the chosen few" (p.19) and he asserts that "the potential to 'join in' with a musical experience through improvising is inborn and present in everyone" (p.19). It is really designed for music therapy students and clinicians. It is geared towards both beginning and experienced pianists and includes the use of other instruments. It begins at a very basic level and progresses to very complex skills. The chapters that I found most valuable as an educator of undergraduate music therapy students were the chapters on musical techniques (Chapter 3), basic therapeutic methods and skills (Chapter 4), advanced therapeutic methods (Chapter 5), transitions (Chapter 6), and group improvisation (Chapter 8). All of these techniques are well explained, masterfully illustrated in the audio and notated example provided, and are further reinforced with readily accessible yet challenging exercises. Throughout, Wigram provides helpful guidelines in terms of strategies with which to experiment. Improvisation: Methods and Techniques for Music Therapy Clinicians, Educators, and Students is a must for all undergraduate music therapy students.This book provides a systematic approach for novice improvisers and as such is a wonderful teaching aid for those who have been reluctant to teach it in their program. This book also covers more complex skills and therefore I also highly recommended it for graduate students, clinicians, and people with improvisation experience. -- Music Therapy Perspectives<br><br>A comprehensive representation of the current international knowledge and practical experiences of music therapeutic interventions, which describes a systematic procedure on different instruments for teachers, students and clinical practitioners, and offers a lot of practical material to aid the development of a personal repertoire of music therapeutic interventions... [Wigram] is the authority to write a book on this topic. -- Musiktherapeutische Umschau<br><br>This bountiful text by experienced musician and researcher Tony Wigram is destined to become a standard on the shelves of music therapists globally. Packed full of ideas and examples, it breaks down the "doing" of improvisation into simple and straightforward sections...A bible for music therapists who use and teach improvisation - I highly recommend it. -- Australian Journal of Music Therapy<br><br>A unique and excellent book of didactics for music therapy academic education, involving the systematisation (and "quantification") of music therapy procedures with a focus of improvisation, and of a Meta methodology of improvisation - especially in music therapy dyad work. While it could be considered first of all as a tutor for students and educators, it is also designed for clinicians to help develop more improvisation skills. As such, it is a handbook of improvisation for clinical practice, to develop more sensitivity to musical material, and to learn a very useful assessment and indication perspective into improvisation as an intervention. -- Nordic Journal of Music Therapy</p><h2>Tricia Foley Life/Style: Elegant Simplicity at Home</h2><p>Designer and lifestyle authority Tricia Foley illustrates her approach to creating elegantly pared-down environments for the home&nbsp;and work space. &#xfeff;Designer Tricia Foley is best known for her timeless classical style, characterized by clean lines, natural materials, and vintage furnishings&#x2014;from flea-market finds to antiques&#x2014;and a palette of calming hues of cream, ivory, and white.

And parents are designed to sleep with their babies.At the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame, anthropologist James McKenna, Ph.D., watches an intimate dance unfold. It's a dance in which there's no leader, no follower, and yet almost seamless choreography.A mother and father sleep with their baby between them in a large bed in the laboratory's comfortable bedroom. It's similar to the way they sleep at home, only with infrared video cameras monitoring their sleep stages, zooming in on every roll of an eyeball, every twitch of muscle, all night long.All is quiet and still, except for the rapidly moving, closed eyes of the baby, mother, and father. They're all dreaming at the same time. Moments later they enter a stage of light sleep together: The mother stirs, awakens for just a moment, anddrifts back to sleep, moving her head a little to the left, her arm to the right. The baby stirs, moves her head to the left, her arm to the right. Then the father follows with the same pattern. McKenna, director of the lab, smiles broadly and nods his head."It's incredible watching these sequences unfold," says McKenna, acclaimed as the father of this type of sleep research, and the world's foremost authority on the biological basis of co-sleeping. "The synchronization that happens when parents sleep beside their baby is remarkable."Similar experiments in England find the same dance with family bedders. But place the baby in another room, and it's like putting a wall between a pair of ballroom dancers. Everyone reverts to their own rhythms, their sleep cycles coinciding only by chance.The beauty of this natural nocturnal waltz rests not only in its well-matched moves, but also in its value for the baby: It turns out to be a great life enhancer. Some researchers say it even has the potential to be a lifesaver.<b>Born Before Their Time</b>Human infants are extremely immature at birth. Even when born at full term, our babies are frightfully ill-equipped to survive without almost constant care. Most mammals are born with 60 to 90 percent of their brain volume and can be independent of their parents within a year.But not human infants. Born with a mere 25 percent of their future brain volume, human babies are the most vulnerable, and most slow-developing, of all mammals.1,2The human setup doesn't sound very sensible, evolution-wise,but nature has its reasons. Back about four million years ago, our ancestors started coming down from the trees and finding that walking on two legs (bipedalism) was of enormous help for a variety of reasons, including foraging, spotting predators, and later, for making and using simple tools.This was a superb step in the right direction, but it came with a hitch: Bipedalism reduced the size of the birth canal. It wasn't a big deal until about two million years later when we experienced a rapid increase in our brain size (and the size of the head that held it). This made for a tough fit when it came to giving birth.3 Eventually push came to shove, and something had to give. Evolution's compromise: Babies born with brains that were a fraction of the size they would become, saving most neurological development for later.4<b>A</b>s any woman who's had a baby in the last few million years can attest to, childbirth is still a bit of a tight squeeze--even with the adaptation of giving birth to babies whose brains are only 25 percent of their final size. Such neurological immaturity makes human babies extraordinarily dependent on their parents and begs for close parental contact night and day.In this sense our nonambulatory, nearly helpless babies are born before their time. In effect they need to finish their gestation outside the womb.<b>Food, Shelter, Clothing ... and Touch</b>The consequences of this immaturity extend far beyond a baby's need to get adequate nutrition, heat, and diaper changes. In the last several years, researchers from academic institutions around the world have demonstrated another essential ingredient to survival: caring human touch.When infants in neonatal wards were placed in the completely controlled environment of an incubator, with a minimum of tactile stimulation, their growth rates were precipitously slow. Yet when caretakers gave these babies a few gentle massages a day, the babies rapidly caught up with their expected growth curves--their little bodies "nourished" by the tender touch of another human.5A new wealth of scientific research is revealing just how essential a parent's physical closeness is to a baby. Being near a parent on a regular basis helps babies regulate many vital functions their fledgling nervous systems have yet to perfect, including heart rate and rhythm, hormone levels, blood pressure, and body temperature.6,7,8 Exactly how some of this information is passed from parent to infant isn't yet clear. In most cases we can witness only the results of this intimate regulation, not the mechanisms behind it. But the results are nothing short of wondrous.For instance, when a mother holds her baby in skin-to-skin contact, her body temperature fluctuates to keep the baby's temperature normal. If the baby is too cold, the mother's temperature increases. When the baby's temperature is normal, the mother's goes back to normal.9 It's as if the mother is a thermostat,effortlessly keeping her baby in the optimal temperature range. This remarkable synchronization continues as long as the two are in contact.The implications of such findings are profound, especially for more fragile babies. When premature babies rest skin-to-skin on a parent's chest for short periods throughout the day, their heart rates and temperatures stabilize more quickly, they sleep more deeply, cry less, breathe better, grow faster, and end up going home sooner than babies who don't receive this "touching" prescription.10A mother's touch can even act as a strong analgesic for newborns. Researchers at the Boston Medical Center found that infants who lie skin-to-skin on their mothers' bellies showed much less pain (crying and grimacing) during routine "heel stick" blood draws than babies left swaddled alone in cribs. Heart rates among the touched babies were also substantially reduced, indicating less distress.11 Since touch can be a powerful pain reliever, babies who have more regular skin-to-skin contact with a parent may have a higher overall comfort level than their less-touched counterparts.&nbsp;<br>A NOTE FROM DR. JAY: <i>In my practice, I give all vaccines when the babies are in mom's or dad's arms. The child feels so much better, and we don't have to deal with as much fear.</i>&nbsp;<br>Touch actually rivals mother's milk as a baby's body builder. In animal experiments, it took less than an hour of separation from the mother for the infant's level of growth hormone to start to decrease.12In the early 1900s, many unfortunate infants perished when raised in institutional environments where all their "standard" needs were met but where they were deprived of touch. What had been thought to be the most beneficial conditions to an infant, such as sterile wards of an orphanage where the baby was rarely handled, proved fatal.13With a need for contact so deeply ingrained in a baby's makeup, it's no wonder that newborns find it extremely stressful to be separated from their parents at night.Some researchers have even suggested that the immaturity of human infants may be a factor in some cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One theory behind SIDS is that some infants fail to rouse themselves from deep sleep during a drop in body temperature or a pause in breathing.14But when babies share a bed with parents, they're partners in the nocturnal dance documented by McKenna. Stimulated by the parents' movements and sounds, babies tend to spend less time in deep sleep, more time in light sleep.15 Although co-sleeping is not a magic pill against SIDS, it may offer some vulnerable babies protection by causing them to avoid long stretches of deep sleep.16 In addition, family bed babies tend to sleep on their sides and backs, possibly because of ease of breast-feeding. This minimizes the face-down sleeping position, which is a known risk factor for SIDS.17Philip, a father of three, is among several parents we've heard from who think the family bed may have been a lifesaver. His youngest child experienced many frightening periods of apnea (breathing cessation) throughout the night. "I'll never know if he would have resumed breathing on his own after all of those periods of apnea if we hadn't been beside him in thebed giving him a little nudge," he says. (See "Bedders Safe, Not Sorry," see here, for a dramatic account of another infant whose life may have been saved by co-sleeping.)It's intriguing that the rate of SIDS is highest in industrial societies where infants sleep separately from their parents. In societies where babies routinely sleep with their parents, the rate of SIDS is considerably lower.18 It would be convenient to argue that the increased SIDS cases in modern societies stem from pollution, parents who smoke, or any of the environmental drawbacks of living in a "developed" culture. But Japan is the fly in that theory's ointment. Japan, where babies routinely sleep with their parents, boasts low SIDS figures more typical of nonindustrialized countries.aIn fact, when people from co-sleeping countries move to the United States, their SIDS rates start out low; but the longer they live in the United States, the higher the rate of SIDS.19 The "Americanization" of their sleep hab...</p><h2>In the Days of Giants (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Strength and joy of life ever marked the doings of the old Norse gods and heroes.

Many of her poems were set to music and appear in collections of songs for school use. Most of her stories were written for children and it was in the field of children&#39;s books, perhaps, that she achieved her greatest success. Miss Brown had a reputation in literary circles before leaving college. She had published in magazines many of her poems and short stories. In 1898 and 1899 a series of articles under the heading of &#34;Girl Gossip&#34; were published in the St. Louis Globe Democrat, and signed with the pseudonym, Jean Neal. The first trip to Europe in 1899 provides the stimulus and inspiration for her first, published, children&#39;s book, &#34;The Book of Saints and Friendly Beasts&#34;, in 1900. Although this was followed by many other books none appears to have been so successful. Frequently Miss Brown was asked to lecture. Usually her talks were about the writing of books for children, a subject upon which she held decided views. Her club memberships included the Saturday Morning Club, Folk Lore Society, Author&#39;s League, Poetry Club of America, and the New England Poetry Club of which she was president at one time. Two outstanding friendships are apparent from these papers; one with Josephine Preston Peabody (Mrs. Lionel Marks), the performance of whose prize play Miss Brown attended in Stratford-on-Avon in 1910. The second was with Caroline Ticknor. Both of these women had interests and backgrounds which paralleled her own.</p><h2>Witness for the Defense: The Accused, the Eyewitness and the Expert Who Puts Memory on Trial</h2><p><p>"The study of memory had become my specialty, my passion. In the next few years I wrote dozens of papers about how memory works and how it fails, but unlike most researchers studying memory, my work kept reaching out into the real world. To what extent, I wondered, could a person's memory be shaped by suggestion? When people witness a serious automobile accident, how accurate is their recollection of the facts? If a witness is questioned by a police officer, will the manner of questioning alter the representation of the memory? Can memories be supplemented with additional, false information?"</p><p>The "passion" Loftus describes in the lines above led her to a teaching career at the University of Washington and, perhaps more importantly, into hundreds of courtrooms as an expert witness on the fallibility of eyewitness accounts. As she has explained in numerous trials, and as she convincingly argues in this absorbing book, eyewitness accounts can be and often are so distorted that they no longer resemble the truth.</p></p><p>Witness for the Defense is a collection of true stories based on Dr. Elizabeth Loftus&#39;s personal experiences as an expert witness. It is our goal to use these real-life courtroom dramas as a vehicle for conveying information about psychology in general and memory in particular.<p><b>Elizabeth Loftus</b> is a professor of psychology and adjunct professor of law at the University of Washington in Seattle. She has published over 250 journal articles and 18 books, including <i>The Myth of Repressed Memory</i>; and <i>Witness for the Defense</i>.

For close to one hundred years, tucsonenses had created their own spatial reality in the historical, predominantly Mexican American heart of the city, an area most called &#x201c;la calle.&#x201d; Here, amid small retail and service shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, they openly lived and celebrated their culture. To make way for the Pueblo Center&#x2019;s new buildings, city officials proceeded to displace la calle&#x2019;s residents and to demolish their ethnically diverse neighborhoods, which, contends Lydia Otero, challenged the spatial and cultural assumptions of postwar modernity, suburbia, and urban planning.<br><br>Otero examines conflicting claims to urban space, place, and history as advanced by two opposing historic preservationist groups: the La Placita Committee and the Tucson Heritage Foundation.

That is why <i>An Introduction to the Homily</i> is not just another how to" book, but a work that leads to a practical understanding of what the Sunday homily is supposed to do. Based on theological and historical foundations, this work provides sound theory for homilists striving to improve their preaching.</p> <p>Chapter one explores the form of preaching called the homily both from historical and contemporary understandings. It fills a void in many Catholic homiletic texts and articles on preaching by offering a brief overview of the "New Homiletic," a new approach that recognizes other homiletic structures besides the deductive or Aristotelian. Chapter two presents an overview of the preacher from four major images within the Catholic homiletic tradition: the herald, the teacher, the interpreter, and the witness. Chapter three examines the origins of the Lectionary to help understand its place in the preaching event and explores some practical solutions to its problems. Chapter four provides helpful responses to questions concerning practical aspects of the homily.</p> <p>Hundreds of books on preaching have appeared since Vatican II, yet these homiletic texts rarely include the theological and liturgical insights from Catholic scholars and church documents. In <i>An Introduction to the Homily</i>, Robert Waznak demonstrates how new homiletic scholarship from Christian churches; the insights found in normative Church documents; contemporary theological, liturgical and biblical studies; plus the lived experiences of preachers and people can help us come to understand the function of the homily in the liturgical tradition of the Church.</p> <p>Chapters are "From Sermon to Homily," "The Preacher as Herald, Teacher, Interpreter, and Witness, "The Lectionary: Richer Fare or Lesser Choice?" and "Questions Often Asked About the Homily."</p> <p>Robert P.

She stood a bit stiffly, careful not to brush against the grease-covered doorframe.</p><p>Pa nodded as he hoisted the bamboo pole and lowered it once again onto the dough on the table. The end of the pole f it into a hole punched in the wall, just above the table surface. As he rolled the pole, the dough became thinner on every pass. It was hard work. I knew his hands were ridged with calluses. Then he sliced the dough into perfectly regular strands with his cleaver, and began pulling them by hand. He twirled them into a rope, then stretched them again and again. It was like magic.</p><p>He looked up to f lash Mrs. Lee a smile. &#x201c;Must be your birthday.&#x201d; </p><p>She actually giggled, a woman of her age. &#x201c;You are an intelligent man.&#x201d;</p><p>I would have snorted, only the waiters pushed another plastic bus tub filled with stacks of bowls through the other window at that moment, the one connecting the dish room to the restaurant. Everybody knew it was good luck to have long noodles on your birthday since they symbolized long life, just as most of us in Chinatown remembered Mrs. Lee&#x2019;s husband had passed on a number of years ago. I dumped the food off the dishes, then piled everything in another tub. I was used to women complimenting Pa&#x2014;but if you&#x2019;re trying to catch him for your own, good luck, lady. Pa hadn&#x2019;t dated since Ma died and probably never would; he was still in love with her. I hefted the heavy tub with ease, then hauled it over to the washing sink. I&#x2019;d been working this job for years, ever since leaving high school, and I had the biceps to prove it. I ducked my head to look through the window again and see what Mrs. Lee was up to. I caught a whiff of ginger and garlic that one of the cooks had just dropped into a wok.</p><p>Pa had given the ends of the dough to his assistant and they&#x2019;d stretched the noodles across the room while the other cook dodged them. Mrs. Lee beamed as Pa rolled up the finished noodles for her. </p><p>&#x201c;You should join us. I promise the noodles will be tender,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Pa gave her an old-fashioned bow from the waist as he handed her package to her. &#x201c;You are very kind but I am so busy taking care of my two daughters. You know how it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; she said. Her bright lips drooped at the corners. &#x201c;Next time, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I wish you long life and happiness,&#x201d; said Pa, turning back to his assistant. &#x201c;Get me a sack of flour from the basement, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>I should have been the one helping him. Pa had brought me to the restaurant to watch and train ever since I was a child. Hard as I tried, I still dropped everything. &#x201c;You have to coax the dough,&#x201d; Pa said, but I pummeled it instead. A noodle master has magic in his fingers. Mine were as clumsy as if I were always wearing gloves. Pa was tall and lean. His defined nose and cheekbones made for a strong face on a man, but those features were too sharp for a woman, according to my Aunt Monica and Uncle Henry. I was tanned like the rest of Pa&#x2019;s family, and for a Chinese girl, I was homely. I had learned early on not to attract any attention. Most of the time, I succeeded.</p><p>I wiped the sweat from my forehead. It was the afternoon lull but my legs were already starting to ache from the hours I&#x2019;d spent on my feet since the early morning. I poured in some detergent, then turned on only the hot faucet and let it f ill the sink. At the beginning, I couldn&#x2019;t bear to put my hands in the scalding water, even when I&#x2019;d diluted it with some cold. I&#x2019;d tried to use gloves until I realized the steaming water poured in over the tops of the gloves anyway when I submerged my arms. But if I was good for nothing but washing dishes, I&#x2019;d resolved to be the best dishwasher I could. I&#x2019;d increased the heat day by day until my body adjusted. I didn&#x2019;t mind the way my hands and arms became reddened and chapped. It was the cost of my labor.</p><p>The rising steam combined with the August heat was stifling. I dropped a stack of bowls into the water, then plunged in my hands and forearms to soap them. My skin had become so rough now I barely winced anymore. The hotter the water, the faster I could work. Although the restaurant had a dishwashing machine, it was so ancient I had to make the dishes as clean as possible before loading it anyway, rather than waste time cleaning out the debris from the machine traps. Otherwise, I would have to check the dishes when they came out of the machine to know they were clean. Especially during the mealtime rush, every second was precious or we&#x2019;d run out of clean dishes and silverware.</p><p>I pulled out another stack of dirty bowls from the bus tub and found a large roach hanging from one of them. I froze. I didn&#x2019;t want to drop everything into the soapy water and have to fish out the now-boiled roach. The bug took advantage of my confusion, racing up my hand and onto my arm.</p><p>I screeched. The dishes I&#x2019;d been holding clattered onto the floor while I batted at the roach, trying to get it off my shirt before it reached my face. Suddenly, a white cooking cloth whipped the roach off of me. It landed upside down on the floor, thick legs waving, and a man&#x2019;s foot smashed it.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the clumsiest dishwasher we&#x2019;ve ever had!&#x201d; said Mr. Hu, the owner of the restaurant. His round cheeks seemed covered with a perpetual layer of grease. &#x201c;Clean it up right away!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I was&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hear it!&#x201d;</p><p>Pa was standing in the doorway. &#x201c;Mr. Hu, she works very hard.&#x201d; </p><p>Mr. Hu softened when he saw my father. Without Pa, his restaurant would lose most of its business. &#x201c;I know. And she is strong too. Just get rid of this mess, okay? Dishes are expensive.&#x201d;</p><p>I started sweeping up the broken crockery right away. When Mr. Hu was gone, I said, &#x201c;Thanks, Pa.&#x201d; Although I could understand Chinese, I couldn&#x2019;t speak it very well. Pa and I usually communicated in English. Sometimes he spoke Chinese and I answered him in English.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone can drop a soapy dish. That man needs a vacation.&#x201d; He gave me an affectionate pat on the shoulder, then went back to the noodle station.</p><p>If it weren&#x2019;t for Pa, I didn&#x2019;t know if the restaurant would have kept me on since there was no shortage of cheap labor. However, I did work hard and I knew the restaurant had gone through a number of dishwashers before I was hired. It was dirty work, even for Chinatown.</p><p>An hour later, I was sleeping across a row of chairs by the wall at the back of the restaurant. All of the staff took naps there during our breaks because our shifts could extend from early morning until late in the night, depending on business. If more customers showed up, the restaurant stayed open. Everyone ignored us as long as we kept our backs to the other tables, and if we didn&#x2019;t snore too loudly.</p><p>Someone tapped me on the side of my head. I jerked awake and peeled my cheek off the vinyl of the chair, annoyed and disoriented. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I saw the yellowing wallpaper, then turned to focus on my little sister Lisa&#x2019;s heart-shaped face. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch my hair.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said but I could tell she&#x2019;d done it on purpose. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t wake up otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>I pushed myself up on one elbow and frowned at her. &#x201c;Did you try?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I know from experience.&#x201d; When I rolled my eyes, she leaned in and whispered, &#x201c;I found an ad for a new job for you.&#x201d;</p><p>---</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t find out what Lisa&#x2019;s job possibility was until after my shift. I&#x2019;d shooed her out of the restaurant after her announcement, before she got me into trouble with Mr. Hu again for dawdling on my break. I knew she&#x2019;d be waiting for me at home. Even though it was late by the time Pa and I arrived at our apartment, Lisa always tried to stay up. If she fell asleep, she&#x2019;d wake up again when she heard us come in because she wanted to make sure we got home safely.</p><p>&#x201c;What could happen in Chinatown?&#x201d; I asked her once.</p><p>&#x201c;Petty theft, knife fights, muggings, gang wars,&#x201d; she answered. She had a point. She was only eleven but Lisa had always been precocious. Sometimes I watched her sleeping and wished I could keep her safe from the life I led. At the very least, I would have liked to keep her ignorant of how tired I was much of the time, but it was impossible to fool her. No matter how often I told her I was satisfied being a dishwasher, Lisa kept trying to find new opportunities for me.</p><p>To be honest, I didn&#x2019;t mind. I wished not for a new job or place but for a different life altogether, to change not the where but the how of things. Some people dreamed of going someplace else; I dreamed of being someone else. Someone who hadn&#x2019;t always been in the bottom half of her class at school. Someone poised, elegant and beautiful&#x2014;like Ma had been, like Lisa would be when she grew up. It was Lisa who took after Ma, from the slight f lush beneath her skin to that gliding grace when she ran. Sometimes I would look at Lisa and Pa and silently ask the gods, &#x201c;Could I please not be born into such a good-looking family in my next life?&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t easy being a cow among gazelles.</p><p>Every night, after saying goodnight to Pa as he retired to his tiny closet of a room, Lisa and I folded up the plastic table in the living room and put it in the corner. My mattress, with the sheets hanging off it, always leaned by the wall. We squeezed that in between the sofa and the pile of three little televisions stacked against the other wall. Only the top one worked, but Pa could never bear to throw away any of the others since they&#x2019;d cost so much. &#x201c;They will be maybe handy someday,&#x201d; he said. Then we pulled off the worn patchwork cloth covering the sofa, exposing the scorch mark I&#x2019;d made when I left the iron on it once. We covered the sofa with a sheet, then piled on Lisa&#x2019;s pillow and blanket, which I had painstakingly sewn together from scraps. She was growing almost too tall to f it on the short sofa and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what we would do then.</p><p>Although I nagged Lisa to go to sleep before Pa and I got home, I secretly looked forward to those moments of peace at night: Lisa lying on the sofa and me on my mattress on the floor below her, when we chatted and read before going to sleep.</p><p>&#x201c;How were Uncle Henry and Aunt Monica today?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>She made a face, then said, &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be ungrateful,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She completed my sentence, &#x201c;&#x2014;lucky that they use me for free slave labor in Uncle Henry&#x2019;s office under the guise of taking care of me. I know.&#x201d; Uncle Henry was a well-known doctor in traditional Chinese medicine in Chinatown. Lisa helped out at his office with tasks like filing and cleaning after school until closing time, then she came home. Now that it was summer vacation, she was there full time.</p><p>I grinned before I could stop myself. &#x201c;How did you become so obnoxious?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same way you got so moralistic.&#x201d;</p><p>We stuck our tongues out at each other, even though I knew I was much too mature for such a thing.</p><p>&#x201c;And I thought you wanted to be a doctor,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good experience for me, even if he&#x2019;s not a western doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, start reading,&#x201d; I said, passing her the paperback book. </p><p>Every night, Lisa had been reading Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress aloud to me before we went to sleep. I&#x2019;d actually started by trying to read to her but I had so much difficulty with it that she took over. In school the words &#x201c;lack of motivation&#x201d; had appeared repeatedly on my report cards, but my teachers never knew about the hours I struggled over my textbooks in the evenings. It was my tenth grade English teacher who&#x2019;d given us the list of Top 100 Classic Books and I was still determined to get through that list. I barely passed that teacher&#x2019;s class and she didn&#x2019;t notice me much, except to ask me a few times to try harder, but I worshipped her from afar, with her sharp wit and wild hair and gesturing hands. I never dared tell her how I fought at home to read her books, how after many hours I would only be halfway through the assignment. I could see the difference between Lisa and me from the moment she started to read, fluently and easily. Even though I was an &#x201c;ABC,&#x201d; American-born Chinese, reading was like a foreign language to me.</p><p>My teachers had always wanted to talk to Pa, but he never dared show up to meet them. He thought his English was too bad and I think he was intimidated by them. He felt his lack of education as a noodle-maker. His brother, our Uncle Henry, was the oldest son and had been rigorously trained in traditional Chinese medicine, although he didn&#x2019;t have a medical degree. There&#x2019;d been no money left for Pa. I&#x2019;d once seen the father of another student at school, arguing with a teacher for his child. For a moment I&#x2019;d allowed myself to think it was Pa and my heart had leapt. Once, Aunt Monica had come to the school in Pa&#x2019;s stead. She spent her time telling my teachers that I needed to help out more at home, that it was shameful my father did most of the cooking. When I told Pa, he&#x2019;d politely refused her help from then on. This was why I made sure I myself went to all of Lisa&#x2019;s teacher meetings now.</p><p>As Lisa f lipped open Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress and started to read, I did my best to pay attention. My legs and arms felt heavy, my back ached from bending over the sinks. I was so glad to be off my feet. Before I knew it, Lisa was tapping me on the head again.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing that?&#x201d; I protested, trying to pretend I&#x2019;d been awake the whole time.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought we were reading this to improve our minds,&#x201d; Lisa said. &#x201c;How can we do that when you&#x2019;re asleep?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sleeping.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;Anymore. And we&#x2019;re improving your mind at least.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before you conk out again, can I tell you about your new job possibility?&#x201d;</p><p>I groaned. &#x201c;Will you stop being such an optimistic little beaver? You know I almost never get hired. And when I do, I just get fired again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s only because you haven&#x2019;t found the right job yet. Take a look at this.&#x201d; Lisa passed me a scrap she&#x2019;d torn out of an English newspaper, probably from her school library. Pa only bought Chinese newspapers, which neither Lisa nor I could read.</p><p>I glanced at the clippi...</p></p><h2>Crow Lake</h2><p>Crow Lake is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so compelling, and with an emotional charge so perfectly controlled, that you sense at once that his is the real thing - a literary experience to relish, a book to lose yourself in, and a name to watch. Here is a gorgeous, slowburning story of families growing up and tearing each other apart in rural Northern Ontario, where tragedy and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. Centerstage are the Morrisons whose tragedy is insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt&#39;s protege, her curious fascination for pondlife fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope, but seems blind to the tragedy of her own emotional life. She thinks she&#39;s outgrown her family, who were once her entire world - but she can&#39;t seem to outgrow her childhood or lighten the weight of their mutual past.</p><p>Canadian writer Mary Lawson's debut novel is a beautifully crafted and shimmering tale of love, death, and redemption. The story, narrated by 26-year-old Kate Morrison, is set in the eponymous Crow Lake, an isolated rural community where time has stood still. The reader dives in and out of a year's worth of Kate's childhood memories--when she was 7 and her parents were killed in an automobile accident that left Kate, her younger sister Bo, and two older brothers, Matt and Luke, orphaned. When Kate, the successful zoologist and professor who is accustomed to dissecting everything through a microscope, receives an invitation to Matt's son's 18th birthday party, she must suddenly analyze her own relationship and come to terms with her past before she forsakes a future with the man she loves. Kate is still in turmoil over the events of that fateful summer and winter 20 years ago when the tragedy of another local family, the Pyes, spilled over into their lives with earth-shattering consequences. But does the tragedy really lie in the past or the present? Lawson's narrative flows effortlessly in ever-increasing circles, swirling impressions in the reader's mind until form takes shape and the reader is left to reflect on the whole. <i>Crow Lake</i> is a wonderful achievement that will ripple in and out of the reader's consciousness long after the last page is turned. <i>--Nicola Perry, Amazon.co.uk</i>Crow Lake is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so emotionally pitch perfect, you know from the opening page that this is the real thing-a literary experience in which to lose yourself, by an author of immense talent. <br>Here is a gorgeous, slow-burning story set in the rural "badlands" of northern Ontario, where heartbreak and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur-offstage. <br>Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt's protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she's outgrown her siblings-Luke, Matt, and Bo-who were once her entire world. <br>In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one's expectations right to the very end. Tragic, funny, unforgettable, Crow Lake is a quiet tour de force that will catapult Mary Lawson to the forefront of fiction writers today. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Etta Mae&#39;s Worst Bad-Luck Day: A Novel</h2><p><b>A delightful standalone novel as told by the sassiest character in the beloved<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Miss Julia series.

But when she becomes the home nurse for an elderly man who is Abbottsville&#x2019;s wealthiest resident, she sees an opportunity to say sayonara to her trailer-park days once and for all. However, a number of interested parties are less than thrilled by the thought of wedding bells, and she&#x2019;ll have to work fast to marry Mr. Right on the worst bad-luck day of her life.</p><p><b><b>Ann B.

She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.<p></p><p>I&#x2019;ll tell you right off that I&#x2019;m not in the habit of talking about people, listening to gossip, or spreading rumors regardless of how tempting it is to pick up the telephone. Do unto others, I always say. I will admit, however, that occasionally I hear a tasty tidbit that just seems meant to be passed along. Yet I&#x2019;ve learned that it&#x2019;s best to first go to the source and check my facts. What one may think is deliciously passable could turn out to be completely inaccurate, thus changing one&#x2019;s entire view of the subject in question.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what happened to me. I&#x2019;ve known Etta Mae Wiggins for several years now, but I&#x2019;d known of her for much longer. Everybody had.</p><p>Not, I assure you, that she was the talk of the town&#x2014;she lived, after all, in Delmont some ten miles or so from Abbotsville, so she wasn&#x2019;t always the number one topic of conversation. In fact, most of us had never met her and wouldn&#x2019;t have known her if we&#x2019;d passed her on the street.</p><p>But just let somebody mention a divorce or a remarriage, and someone else would pop up and ask, &#x201c;Is Etta Mae Wiggins at it again?&#x201d;</p><p>She was, I think, the epitome of what we thought of as a loose woman&#x2014;smart, flashy, bold, and well endowed&#x2014;not a young woman with whom a husband should be left alone. I know of which I speak, for the time that Sam was confined to his house with a broken leg, she was the Handy Home Helper who came twice a week to assist with his therapy and do minor chores for him. That&#x2019;s when I first met her, and I&#x2019;ll tell you the truth, she put my back up immediately. She was much too helpful, standing too close, and petting and pampering him until I thought I&#x2019;d throw up. That was long before Sam declared himself to me, and I was eaten up with jealousy even though I hadn&#x2019;t been able to put a name to it, having never felt that way about Wesley Lloyd Springer. More&#x2019;s the pity, but that&#x2019;s another story.</p><p>Hazel Marie Pickens, n�e Puckett, had known Etta Mae since they were in county schools together, although because Hazel Marie was a few years older, they&#x2019;d never been particularly close. I must mention, however, in spite of Etta Mae&#x2019;s checkered marital career and her spotty reputation, that Hazel Marie has never had an unkind word to say about Etta Mae, which I should&#x2019;ve taken notice of early on, but didn&#x2019;t because Hazel Marie never has an unkind word about anyone. And let me say here that I never should have listened to the gossip about Etta Mae, considering what my own husband at the time&#x2014;Wesley Lloyd Springer, now deceased&#x2014;was up to. Be careful of what you laugh at. It could come back to haunt you.</p><p>But be that as it may, what I&#x2019;d heard about Etta Mae Wiggins did not put me in mind to welcome a friendship with her, and I learned&#x2014;incomprehensible as it seems&#x2014;that she had pretty much felt the same way about me. But in spite of the great difference in our ages&#x2014;no need to mention how great&#x2014;we came to know each other through a series of incidences in which we were thrown together through no premeditation of either of us. I had reason to call on her for help, and each time she&#x2019;d responded willingly and eagerly, although her enthusiasm could noticeably wane on certain occasions&#x2014;like, for instance, when I had need to slip through a bamboo thicket in Florida, or to climb the Abbot County Courthouse dome, or to rescue Mr. Pickens from the clutches of a West Virginia sheriff. But waning enthusiasm never stopped her from following my lead, and, I&#x2019;ll tell you the truth, I would&#x2019;ve never accomplished all I have without her right beside me. Or, more often, right behind me.</p><p>It was on a few of those trips together that I began to see beneath the surface of Etta Mae Wiggins, although that surface was noticeably attractive, especially to a particular type of the opposite gender, like a certain NASCAR driver, that sheriff I&#x2019;ve already mentioned, and innumerable husbands afflicted with eyes they couldn&#x2019;t keep from sliding in her direction.</p><p>See, now, a lot of people would blame her for that, but I didn&#x2019;t and I don&#x2019;t. I put the blame right where it belongs&#x2014;on grown men who can&#x2019;t keep their eyes or their hands to themselves.</p><p>So most of the gossip about her loose and easy ways came about because of what some people hoped to get, not because of what they&#x2019;d actually gotten. And the biggest and most astounding bit of gossip made the rounds a few years ago, before Etta Mae and I knew any more about each other than that I owned the Hillandale Trailer Park and she was a resident in same who was forever calling me to complain about one thing or another.</p><p>I put a stop to that by hiring her to manage the place so she could take her complaints to herself. Unbeknownst to me, however, at the very same time she was up to her neck in what became the talk of the town for weeks. She told me about it later&#x2014;much later&#x2014;after we had warmed to each other and she knew I would not condemn her for it.</p><p>On the contrary, I admire her to this day. That is not to say that I would&#x2019;ve done the same nor would I recommend what she did to anybody else. Still, given the same set of circumstances, who knows what one would do?</p><p>Now, in case anyone unfamiliar with Abbotsville, Delmont, and the residents thereof (including your humble correspondent) happens to come across this story, don&#x2019;t worry about it. All you need to know is contained herein, and you&#x2019;ll be the better for reading it. Etta Mae&#x2019;s story is a salutary one, wholesome and beneficial to anyone who is struggling to improve, to get ahead, and to win respect.</p><p>I would dearly love to tell you this story myself, but as I&#x2019;ve mentioned, I don&#x2019;t carry tales. She, however, is now far enough from the experience to be able to talk about it, and once Etta Mae starts talking, she&#x2019;s hard to stop.</p><p>So this is Etta Mae&#x2019;s story&#x2014;or one of them, at least&#x2014;told in her own words just as it all happened a few years ago when she was alone in this world without the benefit of my watchful oversight and stabilizing influence. And when you know her story as I do&#x2014;what she was up against and what she tried to do about it&#x2014;who among us would throw the first stone?</p><p>Respectfully yours,</p><p>Miss Julia</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Just so you&#x2019;ll know, my name&#x2019;s Etta Mae, Etta Mae Wiggins. Granny always says it doesn&#x2019;t matter what your name happens to be, it&#x2019;s how you act that counts. But when I look around at some of my kin and their actions, I know what everybody thinks when they hear <i>Wiggins</i>. They think lazy, shiftless, no-account, backwoods trailer trash. But they&#x2019;d be wrong about that last part, because none of us ever lived in a trailer. Except me, but only because Bernie Whitlow, my number two ex, bought me one when we got married. And that&#x2019;s where I still live, out off Springer Road in Hillandale Trailer Park a couple of miles from Delmont, and right by myself, too, ever since I kicked Bernie out.</p><p>Regardless of where you live&#x2014;trailer or mansion or somewhere in between&#x2014;and regardless of what Granny says, names do count. They tell who you are, where you&#x2019;ve come from, and what you&#x2019;ve made of yourself, all in one word. I could&#x2019;ve called myself Etta Mae Taggert or Etta Mae Whitlow or Etta Mae Connard, since I&#x2019;ve been, or intend to be, one or the other at various times of my life. In between, though, I&#x2019;ve always gone back to Wiggins, and I don&#x2019;t know why unless it&#x2019;s because I figured I had to start at the bottom all over again each time.</p><p>At the bottom again was where I was after I got rid of Bernie, and good riddance. I&#x2019;d learned my lesson by then, and it was about time since I&#x2019;d made two bad choices in a row. Three, if you count Bobby Lee. Four, if you include Jerry Johnson, which I don&#x2019;t because he hadn&#x2019;t lasted long enough, having his heart set on running around NASCAR racetracks instead of running around with me.</p><p>I had my sights set on a higher prize this time, having figured out what it was I really wanted. And none too soon, since I was knocking at the door of thirty years of age. What it was that I deep-down wanted was a name that people would have to respect. Mrs. Howard Connard, Senior, is who I wanted to be.</p><p>And if I played my cards right, I&#x2019;d get what I wanted. But I didn&#x2019;t intend to be another <i>first</i> Mrs. Howard Connard, Senior, in any way, shape, nor form. The first Mrs. Connard had been a dumpy little woman as near as I could tell from her picture in the newspaper that time years ago when her house had been on the garden tour, and I don&#x2019;t want to be unkind, but she could&#x2019;ve lost a few pounds and it wouldn&#x2019;t have hurt her. Even so, every woman in town who had the means modeled themselves on her. She was the first woman every spring to put away her winter coat with the fur collar and show up at the First Methodist Church of Delmont in a mink stole with a Lady Hamilton camellia pinned on it. That was the signal to all the other ladies that winter was over. She was a fashion statement all by herself, in spite of the extra weight she carried. Some people can get away with it.</p><p>She might&#x2019;ve been a hard act to follow in some people&#x2019;s eyes, but not in Mr. Howard&#x2019;s. You should&#x2019;ve seen them light up in his head every time I came to check his blood pressure and give him his physical therapy. That was my job, to look in on the sick and elderly and incapacitated on a twice-weekly basis.</p><p>I was one of Lurline Corn&#x2019;s Handy Home Helpers, a Medicare-Approved Home Health Care Agency. There were five of us, and we were under contract to provide semiprofessional home nursing care to senior citizens in failing health. We provided a real service, because we&#x2019;d give bed baths and back rubs, treat bedsores, and encourage exercise. We changed sheets, cleaned kitchens, wrote letters, and did all sorts of helpful, as well as some fairly nasty, things for people who couldn&#x2019;t do for themselves. None of us were registered nurses, nor even practical ones, although Lurline helped me get my certified nursing assistant degree so she&#x2019;d have a CNA on her staff and qualify for Medicare reimbursements. Mostly, though, we were just hardworking people who didn&#x2019;t mind doing for our fellow man and getting paid for it.</p><p>Lurline had a nice little business going for her, and I wished I&#x2019;d thought of it myself instead of wasting good years doing makeovers for Mary Kay, taking telephone orders for aluminum siding, and selling cleaning products for Amway.</p><p>You&#x2019;re probably getting an idea by now of what being the second Mrs. Howard Connard, Senior, meant to me, but you&#x2019;d have the whole picture if you knew Mr. Howard, or even of him. He was a man to be reckoned with around Delmont in terms of respect and powers-that-be. He was <i>Mr. Connard, sir</i> to most everybody, but I called him Mr. Howard out of respect for his advanced age and our employer-employee relationship it all started out with.</p><p>The reason Mr. Howard occupied such a position in the minds of Delmontians, and of all Abbot Countians as well, was because he knew money&#x2014;how to make it and how to use it. Take, for instance, how he&#x2019;d seen the handwriting on the wall before the textile business even started its downhill slide. Everybody hated it when he closed the thread mill, sending jobs to China and Taiwan and the like, but we were proud that one of our own knew how to get ahead and stay there. Even if nobody else did.</p><p>I mean, it gave the rest of us hope, even though Tinch Moore knew in his heart that recapping tires wouldn&#x2019;t bring in a fortune. And Harry Tinsley knew that his Ace Hardware Store wouldn&#x2019;t set the world on fire, and Bea Shelton knew that setting hair wasn&#x2019;t going to put her on easy street, even after she installed tanning beds. But Mr. Howard had made it big, and he belonged to Delmont.</p><p>And to me. If I could keep him healthy enough to get through all the prenuptial activities and up to the altar at the First Methodist, come December. That&#x2019;s when we wanted to have the wedding, when my bridesmaids could wear velvet. And also, I was hoping by that time he&#x2019;d be speaking a little clearer and be able to stand without a walker and have a little more strength in his various appendages to manage a honeymoon. Stroke patients take a lot of rehabilitation, you know, which was part of my job, and we&#x2019;d made our plans while I exercised him. We were keeping it a secret, just between the two of us, because we didn&#x2019;t want any interference from people who&#x2019;d want to meddle in our May&#x2013;December romance.</p><p>Mr. Howard, though, could hardly wait and he could hardly keep his good hand off me. I&#x2019;d had to watch him like a hawk from the first day I&#x2019;d shown up and introduced myself as his Handy Home Helper. But that&#x2019;s a man for you. Doesn&#x2019;t matter if they&#x2019;re old or young, weak or strong, men just have this grabbing instinct built inside that they can&#x2019;t, or won&#x2019;t, keep under control. At least that&#x2019;s been my experience with them, and I&#x2019;ve known a few.</p><p>Thinking about men in general and Mr. Howard in particular, I had to smile as I drove to his house for another therapeutic session. Remembering how quick he was with that hand. And where he could get it to before I could catch it.</p><p>But I stopped smiling when I turned into my intended&#x2019;s long, tree-lined driveway in my &#x2019;98 Camaro, with its faded gray body paint, rattling tailpipe, busted AC, duct-taped seat covers, and ninety-something-thousand miles. I knew, as soon as I pulled in near the back entrance, that trouble was already parked and waiting for me. I didn&#x2019;t recognize the brushed gold Cadillac Seville over by the garage, but I knew who had to be its owner. A visitor would&#x2019;ve parked in front.</p><p>I checked my makeup in the rearview mirror, especially my eye shadow and liner. I just hate smudges. First impressions are so important if you aim to get ahead. I wanted whoever it was, though I knew it had to be Junior Connard, Mr. Howard&#x2019;s only son, who should&#x2019;ve been in Raleigh where he belonged, to see me as the professional woman I was. I didn&#x2019;t want to come across as some low-rate, scrub-the-floors kind of person with chewed-off lipstick, nor some loose excuse of a woman with her makeup caked on like a bar pickup, that he was probably expecting, either. Names are important, but the way you look can make up for a lot.</p><p>You see how careful I was.</p><p>I sat there for a minute listening to the early morning quiet, trying to gather my wits. I always liked to look out over the back garden every time I came. So peaceful, all enclosed like it was by shrubbery and flowering trees, with a big square of grass in the middle. I&#x2019;d read about it in <i>The Delmont Daily</i> that time it was on the garden tour when Mr. Howard&#x2019;s first wife had her picture made with her prized camellias blooming behind her. I hadn&#x2019;t paid much attention to the article then, not having any connection to Mr. Howard Connard, Senior, at the time, and not being the type to tour any gardens, either. But the picture had stuck in my mind all these years, and here lately, when I made my regularly scheduled visits, I&#x2019;d let myself imagine what I&#x2019;d look like posing in front of that same camellia bush.</p><p>Well, sitting around thinking about it wasn&#x2019;t getting it done. So I got my black canvas bag and a grocery sack out of the backseat, took a deep breath, and headed for the door.</p><p>I knocked as usual but, not as usual, waited for Emmett to come to the door. He knew the days I came, so he was alway...</p></p><h2>Clownfish Blues: A Novel (Serge Storms)</h2><p><p>A (Serge A.)

The powerful story of a young boy and his tragic fate in World War I makes a terrifying statement on the horrors of war and a compelling plea for peace.</p><p>This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered--not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives...This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome...but so is war.<p>Winner of the National Book Award</p><p> "Mr. Trumbo sets this story down almost without pause or punctuation and with a fury amounting to eloquence."--<i>The New York Times</i></p><p> "It is hard to imaging a more persuasive argument for staying out of war than this smooth, savage, brilliant tale."--<i>Chicago Daily News</i></p>"Johnny Got His Gun" holds a place as one of the classic antiwar novels. First published in 1939, Dalton Trumbo's story of a young American soldier terribly maimed in World War I-- he "survives" armless, legless, and faceless, but with mind intact-- was an immediate bestseller. This fiercely moving novel was a rallying point for many Americans who came of age during World War II, and it became perhaps the most popular novel of protest during the Vietnam era. <p>Citadel Underground's edition of "Johnny Got His Gun" features a powerful new introduction by Ron Kovic, author of "Born on the Fourth of July", and also includes an introduction by Dalton Trumbo. </p><p>""Johnny Got His Gun" still remains the most powerful piece of writing to influence me after Vietnam. Upon my return from the war, and after all these twenty-two years spent in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the mid-chest down, I've read many writers that have influenced my life profoundly-- Hemingway, Conrad, Tolstoy, Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King-- but there has been nothing out of that body of great literature to compare to this book... "Johnny Got His Gun" remains the most revolutionary, searing document against was and injustice ever written." --Ron Kovic, from his introduction </p><p>"{This} is a terrifying book, of an extraordinary emotional intensity." --The Washington Post </p><p>""Johnny Got His Gun" is not merely a powerful antiwar document; it is also a powerful and brilliant work of the imagination... Mr. Trumbo has written a book that can never be forgotten by anyone who reads it." --Saturday Review </p><p>"A terrible story, remorseless, uncompromising... this book was a shocking and violent experience." --Herald Tribune </p><p>"There can be no question of the effectiveness of this book." --The New York Times</p></p><h2>Fiend: The Shocking True Story Of America&#39;s Youngest Serial Killer</h2><p><b>A MONSTER PREYED UPON THE CHILDREN OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY BOSTON. HIS CRIMES WERE APPALLING -- AND YET HE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A CHILD HIMSELF.</b> <br><br> When fourteen-year-old Jesse Pomeroy was arrested in 1874, a nightmarish reign of terror over an unsuspecting city came to an end. "The Boston Boy Fiend" was imprisoned at last. But the complex questions sparked by his ghastly crime spree -- the hows and whys of vicious juvenile crime -- were as relevant in the so-called Age of Innocence as they are today. <br> Jesse Pomeroy was outwardly repellent in appearance, with a gruesome "dead" eye; inside, he was deformed beyond imagining. A sexual sadist of disturbing precocity, he satisfied his atrocious appetites by abducting and torturing his child victims. But soon, the teenager's bloodlust gave way to another obsession: murder. <br> Harold Schechter, whose true-crime masterpieces are "well-documented nightmares for anyone who dares to look" (<i>Peoria Journal Star</i>), brings his acclaimed mix of page-turning storytelling, brilliant insight, and fascinating historical documentation to <i>Fiend</i> -- an unforgettable account from the annals of American crime.</p><p>You've probably never heard of Jesse Pomeroy unless you've read Caleb Carr's 1994 novel, <i>The Alienist</i>, which features a brief prison interview with "America's most famous lifer." But this legendary bogeyman will be hard to forget after you read his life story. Pomeroy tortured and murdered children in Boston in the 1870s. He was himself a child at the time, only 14 when he was finally arrested. Author Harold Schechter, a New York literature professor who has made a name for himself documenting nonfiction accounts of heinous crimes, deftly resurrects the past from newspaper accounts, letters, and other historical documents, including a reform school's massive volume disturbingly titled <i>History of Boys</i>. Schechter doesn't take the easy way out. He could have just pieced together reports and accounts, letting the record stiffly tell the tale. Instead, he blends his research into a seamless story, fascinating in its horror, as well as its ability to turn the century-old characters into real people. The reader will be pleased to find copies of engravings, photos, and sketches of Pomeroy, from his heyday as "boy-fiend," as well as his later days behind bars, when fellow inmates changed his nickname to a less-sinister "Grandpa." Schechter sets out to teach a lesson, and in <i>Fiend</i> he succeeds at reminding us that modern times don't have a monopoly on juvenile terror. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i>Harold Schechter is a professor of American literature and culture. Renowned for his true-crime writing, he is the author of the nonfiction books <i>Fatal</i>, <i>Fiend</i>, <i>Bestial</i>, <i>Deviant</i>, <i>Deranged</i>, <i>Depraved</i>, and, with David Everitt, <i>The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers</i>.

The topic is so critical that everyone, from students to policy-makers to voters, needs a quick and easy guide to the basics. <i>The Cartoon Introduction to Climate Change</i> entertains as it educates, delivering a unique and enjoyable presentation of mind-blowing facts and critical concepts.<br> "Stand-up economist" Yoram Bauman and award-winning illustrator Grady Klein have created the funniest overview of climate science, predictions, and policy that you&#x2019;ll ever read. You&#x2019;ll giggle, but you&#x2019;ll also learn-about everything from Milankovitch cycles to carbon taxes.<br> &nbsp;<br> If those subjects sound daunting, consider that Bauman and Klein have already written two enormously successful cartoon guides to economics, making this notoriously dismal science accessible to countless readers. Bauman has a PhD in economics and has taught at both the high school and college level, but he now makes a living performing at comedy clubs, universities, and conferences, sharing the stage with personalities as diverse as Robin Williams and Paul Krugman.<br> &nbsp;<br> The authors know how to get a laugh-and they know their facts. This cartoon introduction is based on the latest report from the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and integrates Bauman&#x2019;s expertise on economics and policy.<br> &nbsp;<br> If economics can be funny, then climate science can be a riot.

What can Hannah do to help?</p>&#x201c;When I was a child, I was seldom found without a book in my hand. I remember lying in bed late at night with a book hidden under the covers, finishing just one more chapter by flashlight. I remember constantly trying to read in the car, even though I got carsick every time. I remember going to the library of my small New Jersey town and coming home with tall stacks of books &#x2013; enough, I hoped, to get me through the long, lazy summer days. And I remember systematically reading my way through the children&#x2019;s room of that library by category: all the dog stories, all the horse stories, all the mysteries.<p>&#x201c;By the time I was in sixth grade, I felt as if I had read just about every children&#x2019;s book in our local library. The next step seemed easy enough to me. I would write my own book. It would be about a girl and her horse, kind of a modern <i>Black Beauty</i>. With a clean notebook, sharpened pencils, and high hopes, I set to work. But writing turned out to be more difficult than it looked. I had never ridden a horse, and knew very little about them. And I had no idea where my story was going. After three chapters I became discouraged, and abruptly abandoned my writing career.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think seriously about writing books again for a long time. After high school I went to Syracuse University, where I majored in journalism, thinking I would like to work on a magazine. I did that briefly, then drifted into book publishing. Eventually I found myself back in the world of children&#x2019;s books, this time as an editor. And then, finally, I decided to try again to write a book of my own. And this time I was successful.</p><p>&#x201c;Often when I speak with children at schools and libraries, I am asked &#x2018;Where do you get your ideas?&#x2019; This is a big question, and an interesting one.</p><p>&#x201c;When I first began writing, I lived in New York City. Every day I used to walk by a big old-fashioned movie theater and, around the corner from it, a tiny cheese shop. One day I had the idea of writing about a gang of mice living in the movie theater and plotting to get there hands on all that cheese. Why did this appeal to me? I think it was because I liked the idea of creating a secret world in the middle of the bustling city, a world in which wild adventures could take place unnoticed right under people&#x2019;s noses, a world in which the little people &#x2013; the mice &#x2013; outwitted the big people. This book became my first fantasy for children, and introduced Marvin, Raymond, and Fats, characters who have since starred in <i>The Great Summer Camp Catastrophe, The Great Rescue Operation</i>, and <i>The Great Christmas Kidnapping Caper</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;A few years later my own two children, David and Elizabeth, came into my life. With less time for writing, I thought I should try shorter books. Wondering what to write about, I turned to the subject closest to me: my children. I began writing down some of the funny, interesting things that they were doing. After a while I had a collection of these little stories, enough to make a book. To disguise the children, I turned them into pigs, and called the book <i>Tales of Oliver Pig</i>. More ideas led to more stories, and before I knew it I had written a whole series of Easy-to-Read books about the pig family &#x2013; my family.</p><p>&#x201c;Eventually, of course, my children grew up. I still write from the memory of their growing years, as I did in <i>Dear Mom, You&#x2019;re Ruining My Life</i>. But I have also turned to other subjects, including my interest in American history. I have written about the settlement of our country in picture books like <i>Going West, Nothing Here But Trees</i>, and <i>A Fourth of July on the Plains</i>, and in novels like <i>Bound for Oregon</i>. I wrote about the American Revolution in <i>Hannah of Fairfield, Hannah&#x2019;s Helping Hands</i>, and <i>Hannah&#x2019;s Winter of Hope</i>, a trilogy about a Connecticut family.</p><p>&#x201c;But wherever the stories come from, they are really only an excuse for the writer to try to say something to the reader. All of my books seem to have something in common: They are about families. Even Marvin, Raymond, and Fats, the mouse gang, are a little family. And again and again I find that what I am writing about is courage: the courage to try, the courage to face something scary, the courage to be yourself.</p><p>&#x201c;Writing is hard work, as I found out in sixth grade. But I can&#x2019;t imagine any other work that I could enjoy more. There is excitement in creating something that didn&#x2019;t exist before. And a writer is always learning something new, about herself or the world. But perhaps the most satisfying moment comes after a book is published and a letter arrives in the mail from a child telling me, &#x2018;I read your book. And I understand what you&#x2019;re saying.&#x2019; That, for me, is the biggest reward of writing.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the few children&#x2019;s authors working today who is able to write successfully for several different age levels, Ms. Van Leeuwen has written books that have won a wide array of honors, including the William Allen White Award, the South Carolina Children&#x2019;s Book Award, and the Booklist Editors&#x2019; Choices.</p><p>Jean Van Leeuwen lives in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, Bruce Gavril.</p></p><h2>Social Security Strategies: How to Optimize Retirement Benefits, 3rd Edition</h2><p>After having sold tens of thousands of copies and becoming known as the authoritative source on Social Security claiming strategies, this book is now in its third edition.

Meditate. You will find your own peace. You will find your own treasure.&#x201d;</p><p>Meditation is such a great purifier that it washes away the sins of countless lifetimes and removes all the impurities and tensions which beset the mind. Meditation rids us of disease and makes us more skillful at everything we do. Through meditation, our inner awareness expands and our understanding of inner and outer things becomes steadily deeper. Through meditation, we travel to different inner worlds and have innumerable inner experiences. Above all, meditation stills the mind, which constantly wanders, which constantly causes suffering, and establishes us forever in the state of supreme peace, which is independent of any external factors. Ultimately, meditation makes us aware of our own true nature. It is this awareness which removes all suffering and delusion, and this awareness comes only when we see face to face our own inner Self.&#x201c;This book is a specific and practical how-to primer of meditation, but it is more than an outline of a method.

A fully fleshed and often very funny portrait of Beethoven emerges. He struggles with his music and with his health; he argues with and insults just about everyone. Most of all, he worries about his wayward&#x2014;and beloved&#x2014;nephew Karl. A large cast of Dickensian characters surrounds the great composer at the center of this wonderfully engaging novel, which deepens in the end to make a memorable music of its own.</p><p><b>Sanford Friedman </b>(1928&#x2013;2010) was born in New York City. After graduating from the Horace Mann School and the Carnegie Institute of Technology, he was stationed as a military police officer in Korea, earning a Bronze Star.

In her moving vision, relayed through powerfully told stories, respect is not the passive deference offered a superior but an active force that creates symmetry even in unequal relationships.The reader becomes an eyewitness to the remarkable empowering nature of respect, both given and received&#x2014;be it between doctor and patient, teacher and student, photographer and subject, and midwife and laboring mother. They will feel it in the reverent attention paid by a minister to the last moments of life, and in the Harvard Law School professor's lively curiosity about his student's extracurricular lives.Through the power of her narrative, Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot ultimately makes the reader an intimate partner in her observations of respect linking these varied and intense relationships. A book to be savored and shared, <i>Respect</i> has the power to transform lives.</p><p>Respect is a mission, a service, a "way to create symmetry, empathy, and connection"; it is self-generating, a "many-splendored quality" that can build relationships and self-esteem. It is, says author Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, much more than the "static and impersonal" term we often use to describe our deference to traditional hierarchies or symbols. Lawrence-Lightfoot, an award-winning professor at Harvard and the author of several important works of sociology, here observes six subjects known for the respect they bring to their work, inquiring into how this quality has been rooted in and affects each of their lives. From the pediatrician who "sees herself as a servant and helper" to the families she treats to the photographer who believes he can bring out the truth in his subjects only by first making himself vulnerable, the daily heroism of each subject is revealed under the author's warm, curious, respectful eye. Lawrence-Lightfoot even weaves into her inquiry the history of her own African American family and its struggles with gaining and keeping respect. This elegant and accessible book offers alternative models for students, professionals, parents--anyone, really--who would like to harness the healing, strengthening power of this old-fashioned, indispensable quality. <i>--Maria Dolan</i><b>Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot</b> is Professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and MacArthur genius award winner.

Sachiyo Ishii has created 27 delightful mini knitted creatures and a safari mat, arched gateway, four-by-four and camper van to complete the scene. It is easy to knit with one basic pattern and sewing up guide for most of the animals, and uses small amounts of readily available yarn. There are clear, simple knitting patterns and step by step photographs and instructions for all other techniques such as sewing up, stuffing and basic embroidery.</p><p>Sachiyo Ishii was a money broker in Wall Street and London before discovering the joy of crafting after her second son was born, and was very much influenced by the Steiner education system. She has been involved in many different creative activities, and her Waldorf-inspired dolls and knitted and felt toys are well known and loved by many. Her work has appeared in knitting, crafting and parenting magazines both in the UK and USA. Sachiyo lives and works in West Sussex, England.Knit your very own safari park like the ones you see in wildlife documentaries. There is every creature you would expect to see plus a mat to put it all on and even a couple of vehicles to visit the park. All you need is a ranger... ...Or a child to play with it all, or some guests to admire it. This truly is a great way of using up all that leftover yarn and as the items are all small (apart from the mat) you can do a bit in between larger projects. This book does not teach knitting, but the author advises you to start with the mat if you are a knitting newbie as you can practise all the basic stitches (just plain knit and purl) you will need to make the animals. There are twenty-seven of these, most with young and none need a lot of knitting or toymaking know-how. All you need to start are a few basic bits and pieces - a book after my own heart as I am always complaining that so many craft books involve a major shopping spree before you can make anything. Choose from elephant, meerkat, giraffe, panda, crocodile, tiger and my favorites penguin and polar bear ( the last two are ideal for the Christmas tree). There are some less common creatures here too like a gorgeous vulture, impala and giant turtle plus a camper van, off roader and an arched gateway. Each pattern is in written form with photos of the finished creature (usually on white so you can see detail and posed with an appropriate background). Size is given, plus what you need and a difficulty level. This is an attractive and user-friendly book that would make a great gift if you can bear to part with it and is sure to give knitters of all abilities a lot of fun. * Myshelf.com * November 2014 If you enjoy knitting animals, this is a book for you! It contains 27 animal patterns, each one clearly laid out with an accompanying photograph. The difficulty level is rated for each animal, so there are patterns to start with if you are new to knitting, but also challenges if you enjoy them. As well as animals, there is a pattern for a safari mat and vehicles to help you create your own knitted safari park. * Juno Magazine * October 2014 Hand knit 27 fantastic animals for this charming mini safari park, which would make a wonderful gift for a child. The patterns are simple with lots of clear photography&#39;s, so they&#39;re ideal for all skill levels. There&#39;s one basic patterns and sewing up guide for most of the animals and it&#39;s a perfect project for using up oddments of yarn. * Machine Knitting Monthly * September 2014 As soon as I saw this book I was super excited! There are 27 brilliant patterns held in this book. You even get the pattern for the safari mat they go on. Even if you are new to knitting you should be able to give the set a go.

Billy, Kaz, and Big Mike are assigned to investigate a murder close to the front lines in Normandy. An American officer has been found dead in a manor house serving as an advance headquarters outside the town of Tr�vi�res. Major Jerome was far from his own unit, arrived unexpectedly, and was murdered in the dark of night.<br> &nbsp;<br> The investigation is shrouded in secrecy, due to the highly confidential nature of the American unit headquartered nearby in the Norman hedgerow country: the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, aka, the Ghost Army. This vague name covers<br> a thousand-man unit with a unique mission within the US Army: to impersonate other US Army units by creating deceptions using radio traffic, dummy inflatable vehicles, and sound effects, causing the enemy to think they are facing large formations. Not even the units adjacent to their positions know what they are doing. But there are German spies and informants everywhere, and Billy must tread carefully, unmasking the murder while safeguarding the secret of the Ghost Army&#x2014;a secret which, if discovered, could turn the tide of war decisively against the Allies.</p><p>James R. Benn is the author of the Billy Boyle World War II mysteries. The debut,<i>&nbsp;Billy Boyle</i>, was named one of five top mysteries of 2006 by Book Sense and was a Dilys Award nominee.&nbsp;<i>A Blind Goddess</i>&nbsp;was longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and&nbsp;<i>The Rest Is Silence</i>&nbsp;was a Barry Award nominee. Benn, a former librarian, splits his time between the Gulf Coast of Florida and Connecticut with his wife, Deborah Mandel.<b>Chapter One</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The first dead body I saw in Normandy was a cow, tangled in the branches of a shattered tree at a crossroads by the edge of a field, a good thirty feet off the ground. More of them lay scattered across the pasture, the thick green grass dotted with gaping holes of black, smoking earth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few cows were still upright. One wandered into the ditch alongside the road, trailing intestines and bellowing, her big brown eyes crazed with fear and pain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; Sergeant Allan Fair said from the front seat, placing a hand on the driver&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Easy like.&#x201d; The driver, a skinny kid who looked like he might shave soon, if he lived that long, let the jeep roll to a halt. Fair got out, planted his feet, raised his M-1 to his shoulder, and squeezed off a round that found a home between those two brown eyes. The cow collapsed into the ditch, and silence filled the air.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Fair said to no one in particular, and got back in the jeep. The driver eased into first gear and took off slowly, carefully navigating around a shell hole on one side of the hard-packed dirt road. We passed a sign at the crossroads, tilted lazily to one side and peppered with shrapnel.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dust means death.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we drove on, the roadside was decorated with the burned-out hulks of vehicles whose drivers had not heeded the warning. The bovine casualties had likely been the result of a nervous driver who barreled down the road, kicking up a dust storm and making it through before the German shells rained down on the intersection.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think we were close to the front yet,&#x201d; I said from the back seat, as we proceeded at a dust-free twenty miles an hour under the hot morning sun. &#x201c;I mean, for Kraut artillery spotters.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s close enough. They&#x2019;re up in those hills,&#x201d; Fair said, sweeping a hand toward the distant rise to the south. &#x201c;With a good pair of binoculars, they can pick out a swirl of dust five, ten miles away. Plus, they left spotters behind, hiding out in barns or in the woods.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Scuttlebutt is, they pay the French for any dope they bring them about targets,&#x201d; the driver said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hard to imagine any Frenchman would sell information to the Germans,&#x201d; Big Mike said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How long you been in Normandy?&#x201d; Fair asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We got here yesterday,&#x201d; Big Mike said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Figures,&#x201d; was all Fair said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We seen pictures,&#x201d; Big Mike said. &#x201c;People throwing flowers at GIs, stuff like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Anyone throw flowers at you, kid?&#x201d; Fair asked the driver.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A Kraut threw his helmet at me when his rifle jammed,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no flowers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;See? So don&#x2019;t believe everything you read in <i>Stars and Stripes</i>,&#x201d; Fair said. He spat into the road, ending the conversation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Big Mike looked at me, eyebrows raised. Or looked down at me, I should say. Big Mike&#x2014;Staff Sergeant Mike Miecznikowski&#x2014;was tall and broad and took up most of the cramped back seat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I was looking forward to the flowers, Billy,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;In Sicily, all they threw were stones.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The jeep moved slowly, past open fields and into more hedgerows. Here, the roadway became a narrow, sunken lane with a deep ditch on either side. For centuries, farmers had been mounding earth to mark the boundaries of their fields and to keep livestock in. Topping it all off was a tangle of trees and bushes, their roots intertwined with the gritty gravel, dirt, and stone base.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgerows made every pasture a fortress, every lane a death trap.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How long have you been here, Sergeant Fair?&#x201d; I asked. Fair had been ordered to take Big Mike and me from First Army headquarters to the outskirts of Bricqueville, where a dead body was waiting for us. Not the sort that ended up in a tree or torn apart by explosives, but the kind that found itself wearing a slit throat in the sitting room of a French villa, safe behind the lines, and wearing the uniform of a US Army captain. Simply said, it was murder, an almost quaint and old-fashioned custom these days. Killed In Action was the usual phrase, and here in hedgerow country&#x2014;the French call it the <i>bocage</i>&#x2014;there was a lot of it going around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I been on the line since D+3,&#x201d; Fair said, his voice a low mutter as he turned to study me. He did his best to look unimpressed. My ODs were clean, and from the SHAEF patch on my shoulder, I was obviously nothing but a headquarters feather merchant out for a joyride. Fair was headed back to the front, where he&#x2019;d been since three days after D-Day. His olive drabs were worn and muddy, bleached by the summer sun to a shade not found in any Quartermaster&#x2019;s stores. The bags under his eyes were as dark as midnight sin, and crow&#x2019;s-feet arced from the corner of his eye, an occupational hazard from squinting over the sights of an M1.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His mouth was a thin slit of insolence. His eyes were narrowed, wary, and suspicious. He didn&#x2019;t bother saying &#x201c;sir,&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t care about that. At the front, there was an unspoken rank, and it wasn&#x2019;t based on an officer&#x2019;s bars or a non-com&#x2019;s stripes. It had to do with how long a man faced death and kept going despite it. All Fair knew was that Big Mike and I still had the smell of London about us, and that made us nothing but nuisance cargo in his book.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t blame him one damn bit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Anything else, Captain?&#x201d; Fair said, his eyes scanning the road as it curved ahead. Which was obviously of greater interest to him than any stupid questions a desk jockey from Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force had. Probably why he was still alive.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He clamped a hand on the driver&#x2019;s arm, signaling him to roll to a dustless halt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Look, he&#x2019;s making a run for it,&#x201d; Fair said, pointing to a flurry of road dust off to our right, where the land sloped away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Big Mike asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The jerk who got all those cows killed,&#x201d; the driver said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dead meat,&#x201d; Fair said, leaning back and shaking a Lucky Strike loose from a crumpled pack. He lit one, ignoring the sound of distant booms and the screaming crescendo of shells coming in from the German lines. &#x201c;The Krauts got a crossroads over there zeroed in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explosions <i>crumped </i>a mile or so away, just ahead of the dust cloud, belching smoke and fire as they ripped through trees and shrubs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it was over. Fair drew in his smoke as if it were oxygen, cupping the cigarette even in broad daylight.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we see if they need help?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Naw,&#x201d; Fair said, shaking his head at what to him was obviously a silly question. &#x201c;Lemme finish my smoke.&#x201d; He did, tossing the butt into the road as two more shells landed out where smoke from a burning vehicle was already curling into the sky.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Krauts always send a few in after the fact,&#x201d; Fair said, signaling the driver to move on. &#x201c;To pick off guys who don&#x2019;t know any better.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meaning us.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The driver eased his way around the curve, keeping the speed down. Down so much we could have walked and kept pace. But I didn&#x2019;t complain, since I liked not being blown up.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They ain&#x2019;t going to like keeping a stiff around this long,&#x201d; Big Mike said, meaning our murder victim, who had apparently bled out in the sitting room of a farmhouse.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s stiffs all over the place,&#x201d; Fair said. &#x201c;Ours, Krauts, and plenty of French who can&#x2019;t get out of the way fast enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Out of the way of what?&#x201d; Big Mike asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Pissed-off Krauts, our planes bombing and strafing the hell out of everything, artillery, land mines, drunk GIs, you name it,&#x201d; Fair said. &#x201c;If I was them, I&#x2019;d have gone south.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I think they like the idea of being liberated,&#x201d; Big Mike said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s working out just swell for them, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Fair said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He had a point. Along our section of the line, the bridgehead from the beaches to the front lines was no more than eighteen miles deep, after a month of hard fighting and heavy casualties. It was a killing slog for the GIs, but French civilians were often worse off, caught in a cross fire of bullets, shells, bombs, and brutality.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Things weren&#x2019;t going all that well, truth be told. By now we should have broken out of the bridgehead, our tanks rolling toward Paris. But the Allied armies were still cooped up in Normandy, fighting for every hill and hedgerow and paying a heavy price.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; our driver said, pointing to the source of the smoke. A supply truck was on its side, burning, the rubber tires sending up thick, acrid smoke. Two bodies were in the road, thrown from the cab when it had been hit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A couple of Frenchmen knelt by the bodies. They glanced up as we quietly rolled to a halt twenty yards away. One, caught in the act of rifling through the pockets of a dead GI, hastily stuffed a pack of smokes in his jacket. His pal let the arm of the other corpse flop to the ground as he filched a wristwatch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Both soldiers were shoeless, their boots laced and draped around the necks of the Frenchmen. Farmers, by the rough cut of their worn clothes, although most residents of Normandy looked ill fed and poorly clothed these days.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Goddammit,&#x201d; Fair said, stepping out of the jeep and advancing upon the men. I followed, noticing bits of paper scattered in the dirt around the bodies. Photographs and letters, tossed aside as the bodies were looted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The men muttered in rapid-fire French, sounding apologetic, shrugging and smiling as they gestured over the two corpses. I couldn&#x2019;t make out what they were saying, but I could guess. <i>Sorry, we found them like this. It is a shame for good boots to go to waste when we have so little.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fair shot them. Two sharp cracks, a bullet each to the chest. They were both dead before the second shell casing hit the ground, bounced, and rolled to a stop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fucking looters,&#x201d; Fair said. He slung his rifle and moved the GIs off the road, taking a dog tag from each of them. They wore the same shoulder patch as Fair, the red-and-blue 30th Infantry Division insignia. He gathered up papers and stuffed them inside each man&#x2019;s jacket. Then he took the boots and watches from the Frenchmen, left a pair of boots next to each GI, and shoved the wristwatches into their shirt pockets. He stood for a moment, shaking his head slowly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not right,&#x201d; our driver said, his hands resting on the steering wheel. &#x201c;Stealing from the dead. Especially when them boys are from our own outfit.&#x201d; He sounded angry and apologetic at the same time. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They were idiots, driving like that,&#x201d; Fair said, stuffing the dog tags into his jacket as he returned to the jeep. &#x201c;But no one has a right to take from our dead. Right, Captain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You could have turned them over to the military police, Sergeant,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What, and make you and your pal walk? Sorry, Captain, but I got my orders. No one loots our dead, and I take you to Bricqueville. So mount up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drove on at a snail&#x2019;s pace, past the dead, both the young and foolish Americans who had come to liberate France, and the old and foolish French who stole their boots. None of them expected to die today on this dusty stretch of road, but there they were, shattered bodies in a ditch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I would&#x2019;ve shot them,&#x201d; Big Mike said in a low voice, leaning in close. &#x201c;But I wanted to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, I didn&#x2019;t like seeing them paw over our boys,&#x201d; I said. Which was true enough. But I also didn&#x2019;t like Sergeant Fair much either. Maybe because he did what I, like Big Mike, wanted to do myself. It&#x2019;s not pleasant to see the worst of yourself in another man, so I tried to think about something else. Like the dead body waiting for us down the road.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dust means death. Like that line from Genesis that scared me back in Sunday school: <i>For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Keep it slow,&#x201d; I told the driver. &#x201c;The dead can wait.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Cades Cove Childhood (American Heritage)</h2><p>The remote Smoky Mountain community of Cades Cove still lives in the memory of J.C.

He&#x2019;s hired his stepdaughter, Dakota, to find Simon. Hot on Simon&#x2019;s heels, the gutsy P.I. puts love on the back burner. But when attempts are made on Dakota&#x2019;s life, Simon steps in to protect her, all but putting both their hearts on the line...</p><p><b>Lori Foster</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of many contemporary romances.Dakota Dream has been hired by her stepfather, Barnaby, to find Simon Evans, an extreme fighter preparing for a comeback fight with Dean Havoc Conor (introduced in Causing Havoc, 2007), and arrange a meeting. Barnaby claims to be Simon&#39;s long-missing birth father. When Dakota shows up at the gym, Simon is instantly attracted to her but rejects her request to see Barnaby. Dakota is desperate because Barnaby is threatening to burn her mother&#39;s last letters to her unless she produces Simon. As things heat up between Dakota and Simon, she keeps secrets and he feels betrayed. Foster shapes a fun sequel, thanks to Dakota, an interesting character with a big heart, good head, and checkered past. The second in the series reads reasonably well as a stand-alone, although this sort of plot about lying has been done to death in romances, and there are some flaws. Foster fans, however, will deem all glitches irrelevant.

A devout book lover who somehow fell out of the habit of reading, he began to ponder the power of books to change an individual life&#x2014;including his own&#x2014;and to the define the sort of person he would like to be. Beginning with a copy of Bulgakov's <em>Master and Margarita</em> that he happens to find one day in a bookstore, he embarks on a literary odyssey of mindful reading and wry introspection. From <em>Middlemarch</em> to <em>Anna Karenina</em> to <em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em>, these are books Miller felt he should read; books he'd always wanted to read; books he'd previously started but hadn't finished; and books he'd lied about having read to impress people.</p><p>Combining memoir and literary criticism, <em>The Year of Reading Dangerously</em> is Miller's heartfelt, humorous, and honest examination of what it means to be a reader. Passionately believing that books deserve to be read, enjoyed, and debated in the real world, Miller documents his reading experiences and how they resonated in his daily life and ultimately his very sense of self. The result is a witty and insightful journey of discovery and soul-searching that celebrates the abiding miracle of the book and the power of reading.</p></p><p><p>A working father whose life no longer feels like his own discovers the transforming powers of great (and downright terrible) literature in this laugh-out-loud memoir.</p><p>Andy Miller had a job he quite liked, a family he loved, and no time at all for reading. Or so he kept telling himself. But, no matter how busy or tired he was, something kept niggling at him. Books. Books he'd always wanted to read. Books he'd said he'd read that he actually hadn't. Books that whispered the promise of escape from the daily grind. And so, with the turn of a page, Andy began a year of reading that was to transform his life completely.</p><p>This book is Andy's inspirational and very funny account of his expedition through literature: classic, cult, and everything in between. Beginning with a copy of Bulgakov's <em>Master and Margarita</em> that he happens to find one day in a bookstore, he embarks on a literary odyssey. From <em>Middlemarch</em> to <em>Anna Karenina</em> to <em>A Confederacy of Dunces</em>, this is a heartfelt, humorous, and honest examination of what it means to be a reader, and a witty and insightful journey of discovery and soul-searching that celebrates the abiding miracle of the book and the power of reading.</p><p>Andy Miller is a reader, author, and editor of books.

While their songs still get airtime and some of these bands continue to tour, its idols are leaving the stage permanently. Can classic rock remain relevant as these legends die off, or will this major musical subculture fade away as many have before, Steven Hyden asks.</p><p>In this mix of personal memoir, criticism, and journalism, Hyden stands witness as classic rock reaches the precipice. Traveling to the eclectic places where geriatric rockers are still making music, he talks to the artists and fans who have aged with them, explores the ways that classic rock has changed the culture, investigates the rise and fall of classic rock radio, and turns to live bootlegs, tell-all rock biographies, and even the liner notes of rock&#x2019;s greatest masterpieces to tell the story of what this music meant, and how it will be remembered, for fans like himself.</p><p><em>Twilight of the Gods</em> is also Hyden&#x2019;s story. Celebrating his love of this incredible music that has taken him from adolescence to fatherhood, he ponders two essential questions: Is it time to give up on his childhood heroes, or can this music teach him about growing old with his hopes and dreams intact? And what can we all learn from rock gods and their music&#x2014;are they ephemeral or eternal?</p></p><p><p><strong>How can classic rock live on when its idols are dying all around us?</strong></p><p><em>Twilight of the Gods</em> is a bold, often humorous, and provocative book about our rock gods and the undeniable messages they leave behind. Since the 1960s, artists like the Rolling Stones, the Who, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Black Sabbath, and Bruce Springsteen have ushered the classic rock canon forward. Even groups that are no longer active&#x2014;the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin&#x2014;continue to wield an outsized amount of cultural capital. But no matter how entrenched these classic rockers have been, you can already see signs of their decline.</p><p>Mixing personal memoir, criticism, and journalism, Steven Hyden, author of the critically acclaimed <em>Your Favorite Band Is Killing Me</em>, explores the ways that classic rock changed the culture&#x2014;how it established the album as music&#x2019;s answer to the novel and rock concerts as the secular equivalent to church&#x2014;and asks whether any of these signposts can endure. He investigates the rise and fall of classic rock radio and asks whether the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is telling the right version of rock history. <em>Twilight of the Gods</em> explains what we can learn from rock gods and their music, and tries to answer the most important question: Is classic rock ephemeral or forever?</p><p>Steven Hyden is the author of <em>Your Favorite Band Is Killing Me</em>.

Poems from his <i>Divan</i> (collected works) are memorized by men, women, and children from all strands of society, from scholars to school children, entrepreneurs to nomads. Hafiz was the unrivaled master of the ghazal, a lyric form roughly equivalent to the English sonnet in length, intensity, and complexity. <br><br><i>Wine &amp; Prayer</i> is a new edition of Elizabeth Gray&#x2019;s 1995 work <i>The Green Sea of Heaven</i>. In this new volume, Gray has joined with Iraj Anvar, a scholar of Sufism and Persian poetry, expanding the book from fifty to eighty translations of Hafiz&#x2019;s brilliant <i>ghazals</i>. This work brings to each reader Hafiz&#x2019;s poetic genius, expressing his passion for the Divine Beloved and his scandalous (to the Muslim clergy of his day) exaltation of music and wine as vehicles of transcendence and ecstasy.<br><i>Wine &amp; Prayer</i> presents the <i>ghazals</i> of Hafiz in English translations that capture the subtleties, paradoxes, and spiritual depths of the poet hailed by Persians as &#x201c;the Tongue of the Invisible&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Interpreter of Mysteries.&#x201d;</p><p>ELIZABETH T.

She lives in New York City.Praise for <i>Wine &amp; Prayer</i><br><br>&#x201c;Elizabeth Gray&#x2019;s previous translation of Hafiz (Green Sea of Heaven) was a classic. It achieved the almost impossible, rendering the virtually untranslatable Hafiz into beautiful and accurate poetry. Here, in Wine and Prayer, we are treated to an expanded edition of that classic, featuring 30 new luminous ghazals. There are so many fake translations of Hafiz floating around, offering &#x2018;versions&#x2019; that have no earthly connection to anything that the Persian poet and sage of Shiraz named Hafiz ever said. Elizabeth Gray offers us something different: poetic translations rooted in close readings of the original Persian, developed in consultation with a native speaker scholar. <i>Wine and Prayer</i> is highly recommended for all lovers of Hafiz and Sufi poetry.&#x201d;<br><br>~ Omid Safi, professor of Islamic thought at Duke University and author of <i>Memories of Muhammad</i> and <i>Radical Love: Teachings from the Islamic Mystical Tradition</i><br>&#x201c;This is a groundbreaking work, one that places the ghazal of H�fiz into a contemporary English poetic idiom . . .

Sometimes brave, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet or filled with anger, these voices combine to make <i>Firefighters</i> both a riveting adventure drama and a moving chronicle of American heroism at its finest.</p><p><b>Dennis Smith</b> grew up in the tenements of New York's East side. After a stint in the U.S. Air Force, he was appointed to the New York Fire Department. An active firefighter for 18 years, he retired to become the publisher and editor in chief of Firehouse Magazine, a Honorary Deputy Chief of the New York City Fire Department and Chairman of the New York Academy of Art. He has written several books about firemen, four of which have been New York Times bestsellers, including <i>Report from Engine Co. #82</i>, and <i>Firefighting in America</i>. He is also the author of the novels, <i>The Final Fire</i>, <i>Glitter and Ash</i>, and <i>Steely Blue. </i>Training and First Fare<br><br>When I got called for the fireman&#x2019;s job, I was sent to the fire department training school to learn all the things you have to know to be a professional firefighter.<br><br>The training school confronts you with a lot of tough situations. They put you in really heavy smoke without masks, so you get a sense of what it&#x2019;s like to be in a terribly hostile environment, one that&#x2019; like claws around your neck, just squeezing and squeezing. You get an understanding of what it&#x2019;s like to work in complete darkness, where you&#x2019;re totally blind. This is what it&#x2019;s like to be in a burning building, you learn.<br><br>You&#x2019;re also taught many other things. You learn how to use the equipment, the fire trucks, the Halligan tool (it&#x2019;s a pry bar with a fork on one end and a point and adz on the other), the axes, the claw tools, and hooks. You&#x2019;re taught how to use hoses and nozzles, how to stretch hose, hump hose, pack hose. You learn the science of fire. You learn how fire travels. You learn the various kinds of building construction. You know what kind of windows to expect in different buildings, and you know how to deal with those windows and whether to break them or not.<br><br>In a way, it&#x2019;s like studying to be a lawyer or a doctor. In law school, the student studies law books, goes through mock trials, and says, &#x201d;Hey, I really know what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d; Then he finds it&#x2019;s a lot different when he&#x2019;s in an actual courtroom. The medical student studies chemistry, physiology, anatomy, and how to use a scalpel. But once he gets into an actual operating room, it&#x2019;s different&#x2013;suddenly people&#x2019;s lives are at stake. It&#x2019;s no longer an academic confrontation. It&#x2019;s right now. <br><br>It&#x2019;s the same thing with a firefighter. You learn all these things in training school so that when you are out in the field in an emergency situation, you know where to go and what to do, so that your actions will be effective.<br><br>Here I was, a trained firefighter. I got assigned to a firehouse in Queens. The men I worked with there were great guys, what we call stand-up guys. They had fast lips, they could get around any situation with their mouths when they couldn&#x2019;t do it with their dukes. You meet all kinds of personalities in a firehouse. They&#x2019;re all fundamentally good guys who care about other people. That, in my opinion, is what sets them apart. That&#x2019;s not to say that you have a room full of Francis of Assisi types figuring out how they&#x2019;re going to help the poor. But in an emergency situation they care about what happens to people.<br><br>I got to the firehouse, met these guys. Then, of course, the alarm started ringing. So I went through a few alarms. Maybe it was a false alarm, a garbage pail on fire, a car accident, maybe somebody went out to get a paper and left on the stove. All of these things can happen.<br><br>I remember the first fire. Not a really great fire, but there were a couple of things that happened that day that stick in my memory. The area outside is called the apron. When the fire trucks are coming out, the two firemen are out there stopping traffic. In those days two firemen rode on the back step of the fire engine. We don&#x2019;t do that anymore because it&#x2019;s unsafe.<br><br>I remember being on the back of the rig, it&#x2019;s two in the afternoon and I&#x2019;m putting on my coat, with one arm in the D-ring hanging there like a subway strap. The truck is stopped momentarily, waiting for the traffic to halt. I look up, and who walks by but a priest from St. Mary&#x2019;s parish up by Queens Boulevard. He looks over, and he blesses me and the guy beside me on the back of the truck. Now, the other guy may be an atheist for all I know, but I have this priest blessing me, so I make the sign of the cross, a conditioned response like a dog salivating to a stimulus. <br><br>We get going, and I&#x2019;m thinking, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here? I&#x2019;m just doing my job, and this priest is blessing me on the sidewalks of New York.&#x201d; I guess in his head he&#x2019;s saying, these guys have a tremendously tough job and they might be in a bit of trouble, so I&#x2019;ll bless them. But at that point I don&#x2019;t want anybody reminding me that I might be in trouble. All I know is that I&#x2019;ve been blessed, and that we are going to this alarm.<br><br>From blocks away I could smell the wood burning. It has a particular smell, not like a car fire, for instance, which has a heavy smell of plastic and rubber. This was a two-story frame building in a row of houses typical of that area of Queens, generally lived in by working-class people. It could have been Archie Bunker&#x2019;s house, because they filmed the introductory sequence to that TV show in this neighborhood.<br><br>The first thing I thought of, what every firefighter thinks of, was: &#x201c;is there anybody inside, how bad is the fire, and what is the immediate thing to do?&#x201d; One of the saving things about being a trooper in a war is that there is leadership you can rely on, and in the fire department we have a lieutenant or a captain on every truck. I was probably with the captain, Captain Finnegan, because I was a probationary firefighter, and they always put a probie with the captain so the captain can keep an eye on him and assess his performance. The captain has to make reports and decide whether he wants to keep him or transfer him after six months.<br><br>I&#x2019;m in an engine company, and the captain says, &#x201c;Okay, stretch a two-and-a-half-inch line.&#x201d; This tells us it&#x2019;s a serious fire, because for a small fire you stretch a smaller line. This was the way we were trained. So we stretch the hose into the building, and I&#x2019;m still thinking that I&#x2019;m probably in better shape than the other because I was blessed. The ladder company arrives, and they immediately go in and do a search. I don&#x2019;t remember anybody being caught in the fire, maybe somebody was, but it didn&#x2019;t matter to me at the time. I had my job to do.<br><br>We&#x2019;re on our stomachs, crawling into this fire, and I&#x2019;m humping, pulling, this gargantuan snake of a hose filled with water. Fifty feet of it weighs ninety pounds when it&#x2019;s dry, so you can imagine how much it weighs when it&#x2019;s filled with water. There is a black, dense smoke, and we can&#x2019;t see an inch in front of us. There&#x2019;s a red glow in the background, and we&#x2019;re pushing toward it. Without masks. Making it a &#x201c;snotty&#x201d; fire, that&#x2019;s one where for every square inch of smoke you ingest a square inch of something else comes out of through your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br><br>The red glow is in the back of the building, and we learn later that the fire has gone out through the back windows and is shooting up to the afternoon sky. We&#x2019;re on our stomachs, the guy on the nozzle, myself, and the captain behind me, advancing slowly into the fire. Then all of a sudden, this big guy, another firefighter, comes in and jumps on top of the hose, he grabs it from the hands of our nozzle man, and he runs with in in a crouch toward the red glow. Apparently we&#x2019;re not moving fast enough for him for some reason.<br><br>None of us have smoke masks or SCBAs (self-contained breathing apparatus), so we're all choking. Then we start cursing, "Hey, what the hell is this guy doing?" And our nozzle goes running after the guy, following the string of hose that's dancing in front of him. This big guy pulls up maybe fifteen feet, throws himself on the floor, opens the nozzle, and hits the ceiling. The red glow darkens to blackness. He has stopped the fire. It's amazing, you can have a whole big room on fire, and a two-and-a-half- inch hose will put it out in twelve seconds.<br><br>My captain was really mad. He said, "What the hell are you doing?"<br><br>And the guy said, "Listen, I got the job done, right?"<br><br>Well, the captain let it go. I didn't say anything because I was new on the job. But I felt that this was our line and our hose, and our territory had been infringed on. Later I heard about the old-time firefighters in New York back in the nineteenth century, when the territory was the main thing and there was competition between one firehouse and another. When an alarm came, they'd send one firefighter ahead with a barrel while they got the horses and everything else ready, and he'd slip the barrel over the fire hydrant. And if another gang tried to use it, he'd fight them off. They'd have big fistfights over this hydrant, because the first team to get the water would have control over the fire. But at that first fire of mine I just knew that somehow we should have put out the fire, particularly, I suppose, in view of the fact that I was well protected by the blessing. <br><br>What I learned is that it is your job to control the nozzle, and that every fire is a personal confrontation. This is your job, and you have to go in there and put the fire out, and a lot of people are watching you to be assured that the fire is being put out.<br><br>Firefighting is a highly coordinated job. You don't begin ventilating a building, for instance, opening windows or doors or breaking windows, until there is water in the hose and the water is shooting out of it. Then you operate in a mathematically correct way. What you're doing is creating pressure inside the room, and the pressure has to have some way of being released, so you break some windows. This is called ventilation. Otherwise, you have the energy of the fire and the energy of the water shooting from the hose, and you have nowhere for all this energy to go. It will just blow back at you toward the door you came in, where there's oxygen. That is what creates flashover fires, when the fire and heat search for oxygen and the fire flashes as it consumes oxygen.<br><br>I carried that lesson with me for the rest of my life. The hose is your job, and you have to do the job. If you don't do it and somebody else does, that's hard to live with.<br><br>Dennis Smith</p><h2>The Doughnut King (The Doughnut Fix)</h2><p><p><strong>When Tris tries to save his doughnut business and town by competing on a cooking show, will he have what a takes, or lose it all?</strong></p><p>Tris Levin thought moving from New York City to middle-of-nowhere Petersville meant life would definitely get worse...only it actually got better.

Mary Oliver has called this project &#x201c;gorgeous,&#x201d; and said that he "speaks of the events that have no larger or more important rival in our lives&#x2014;of our love and our loving."</p><p><i>If to say it once</i><br><i>And once only, then still</i><br><i>To say: Yes.</i></p><p><i>And say it complete,</i><br><i>Say it as if the word</i><br><i>Filled the whole moment</i><br><i>With its absolute saying.</i></p><p><i>Later for &#x201c;but,&#x201d; </i><br><i>Later for &#x201c;if.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Now</i><br><i>Only the single syllable</i><br><i>That is the beloved.</i><br><i>That is the world.</i></p><p><b>Gregory Orr</b> is the author of ten books of poetry. He teaches at the University of Virginia and lives in Charlottesville.</p></p><p>Gregory Orr is the author of ten books of poetry, four collections of criticism, and a memoir that was selected by Publishers Weekly as a &#34;Best Book of the Year.&#34; The former poetry editor for the Virginia Quarterly Review, Orr teaches at the University of Virginia and lives in Charlottesville.In his sequel to <i>Concerning the Book That Is the Body of the Beloved</i> (2005), Orr offers more short (many don't break 10 lines), earnest poems that take as their central metaphor the beloved, Orr's word for a conflation of a loved human being, the idea of a kind of higher power beyond the self at which love and energy are directed, and the poetry itself, which bears all this praise in what Orr calls the Book. The best of these poems are compact missives addressing in the most direct language possible many of humanity's most dire needs and fears: That single line: a rope/ The poem tossed out/ Into the dark./... / You're holding one end; The beloved, the other.// Rescue is imminent.// Too soon to say whose. Elsewhere, the language is so direct that it's more like journaling than poetry. Most perplexing and interesting, however, are many poems in which the language <i>would</i> fall flat, except that Orr's line breaks add meaning and almost Rilkian power; imagine this going down the page: ...death is real, and all/ That is/ Flows toward its brink.// No wonder we need/ Hope and courage&#x2014;// What the book brings. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The lure is liturgy and tradition, and since the Evangelical and Reformed churches so often have such poor worship, it is not hard to understand the pull exercised by those churches that have a heritage of formality, sobriety and beauty. This cure, however, is far worse than the disease. The answer to the weaknesses of Evangelicalism is not a turn toward the fallacies and errors of Rome, Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism, but a return to Biblical patterns of worship. Just as there is true and false doctrine, so there are true and false worship patterns. In this book, James B. Jordan sorts out the true and the false in the area of worship practice, discussing the cult of the saints, the veneration of icons, apostolic succession, virginity and celibacy, the presence of Christ at His Supper, and the doctrine of tradition.</p><p>James B. Jordan holds an M.A. and a ThM from Westminster Theological Seminary and a DLitt from the Central School of Religion. He has served as a pastor in Texas, and was the director and chief instructor at Geneva Divinity School. He is now the director of Biblical Horizons, and lives in Niceville, Florida.</p><h2>The Second Treatise on Civil Government (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>As one of the early Enlightenment philosophers in England, John Locke sought to bring reason and critical intelligence to the discussion of the origins of civil society.Endeavoring to reconstruct the nature and purpose of government, a social contract theory is proposed. The Second Treatise sets forth a detailed discussion of how civil society came to be and the nature of its inception. Locke&#39;s discussion of tacit consent, separation of powers, and the right of citizens to revolt against repressive governments, has made The Second Treatise one of the most influential essays in the history of political philosophy.</p><p><b>JOHN LOCKE</b> was born August 29, 1632, in Somerset, England, the son of landed English gentry. He entered Christ Church College of Oxford Univer�sity in 1652 and passed through the academic ranks quite uneventfully, later assuming a teaching post at the university. To escape ordination in the Church of England&#x2014;a natural bureaucratic step toward university pro�motion&#x2014;Locke took up the study of medicine and was transported into a new world of "natural philosophy" in which he associated with powerful scientific minds like that of Robert Boyle.<br><br> It was through his concern for the authority of the state in religious matters and the Natural Law used to support it that Locke became inter�ested in the role of Natural Law in experience&#x2014;a curiosity that led him to philosophy, and more particularly to epistemology, as an avocation. Add to his interest in Natural Law the sociopolitical climate of seventeenth-century England&#x2014;steeped in violent civil war, counter-revolution, restoration, deposition of the monarchy and the subsequent Parliamentary rule, and the eventual restoration of the monarchy late in the century&#x2014;along with an intellectual stage dominated by the authoritarianism of Thomas Hobbes's <i>Leviathan, </i>and one can begin to sense the pressures at work on Locke.<br><br> After accepting a brief diplomatic mission to Madrid in 1665, Locke retreated to his teaching and medical experiments. His real political educa�tion was to come quite by accident as a result of an association with the first Earl of Shaftesbury, a wealthy and extremely powerful figure who had survived the vicissitudes of England's political turbulence. Initially employed as the Earl's medical advisor, Locke later became a permanent member of the household. It was here under the skillful tutelage of Shaftesbury that Locke matured as a social philosopher. The political intrigues in which the Earl was engaged caused Locke to be exiled, though he later returned to England after the Glorious Revolution that saw William and Mary placed on the English throne in 1688.<br><br> Locke's famous <i>Two Treatises of Government, </i>of which the second is most widely read, are an outgrowth of his original political proclivities, the sociopolitical chaos plaguing England during his lifetime, and his associa�tion with the Earl of Shaftesbury. Locke's dedication to individual liberty, government by consent, the social contract, and the right to revolt against governments that endanger the rights of citizens, has made him one of the most important political thinkers of the past four centuries. His legacy will live on as long as there are people fighting for freedom. He died in Oates, England, on October 28, 1704.<br><br> Some of John Locke's major works include: <i>A Letter for Toleration </i>(1689), <i>Two Treatises of Government </i>(1690), <i>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding </i>(1693), <i>Some Thoughts Concerning Education </i>(1693), and <i>The Reasonableness of Christianity </i>(1695).</p><h2>Drawn from Nature</h2><p><b><i>An intricately crafted journey through four seasons of flora and fauna</i></b><br><br>Helen Ahpornsiri's intricate artwork transforms leaves, petals, and seeds into bounding hares, swooping swallows, and blossoming trees.

Does it matter if your coffee is fair trade or not? It matters--more than you might think. Julie Clawson takes us on a tour of everyday life and shows how our ordinary lifestyle choices have big implications for justice around the world. She unpacks how we get our food and clothing and shows us the surprising costs of consumer waste. How we live can make a difference not only for our own health but also for the well-being of people across the globe. The more sustainable our lifestyle, the more just our world will be. Everyday justice is one way of loving God and our neighbors. We can live more ethically, through the little and big decisions we make every day. Here&#39;s how.</p><p>&#34;Living justly is an overwhelming task these days. How do I know whether the coffee I&#39;m drinking was fairly grown? Or whether my jeans were made by a twelve-year-old? It&#39;s daunting, and we&#39;re tempted toward apathy. That&#39;s why Julie Clawson has done us such a service in writing Everyday Justice--in readable, compelling prose, she lays out the truth behind some of the products we use every day, and she gives us practical steps for living justly in a consumeristic age.

A Memoir of Philip Guston</h2><p>Philip Guston (1913-1980) is one of the outstanding figures in twentieth century American art. Beginning as a muralist in the thirties, Guston embraced the lyrical vocabulary of Abstract Expressionism in his paintings and drawings after his move to the East Coast. Following an artistic crisis in the mid-sixties, his return to figuration focusing first on simple things of ordinary life, later evolving to the enigmatic and iconic cartoonlike forms for which he is now best known shook the art world. Night Studio is a deeply personal account of growing up in the shadow of a great artist, a daughter's quest to better understand her father, based on letters and notes by the artist, and interviews with those who knew him. First published to critical acclaim in 1988, this beautifully designed new edition is richly illustrated with a new selection of photographs and paintings, many in color. <br><br>Also available: <br>Philip Guston: Drawings for Poets ISBN 9783944874197<br>Philip Guston: Prints ISBN 9783944874180</p><p>Philip Guston (1913-1980) was driven, sustained, and consumed by art. His style ranged from the social realism of his WPA murals through his abstract expressionist canvasses of the 1950s and 1960s (when he counted Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline among his friends) to his cartoonlike paintings of Klansmen, disembodied heads, and tangled piles of everyday objects. Critics and public alike savaged Guston for his return to figurative art, but today his late work is recognized for the singular power of his personal, darkly hilarious vision. Musa Mayer augments her firsthand knowledge with extensive interviews with his family, friends, students, and colleagues, as well as Guston&#39;s own letters, notes, and autobiographical writings, to re-create a turbulent era in American art. Night Studio, profusely illustrated (including almost a dozen paintings in full color), illuminates not only the life of a great artist, but the experience of growing up in his overwhelming shadow.</p><h2>Rhythms of Change</h2><p>East Asian medicine has a profound understanding of the oneness of body, mind, and spirit.

Addressing the current conflicting weight-loss trends, Jamieson, who directs <i>Eating Well</i>'s test kitchens, makes the case for understanding (rather than eliminating) carbohydrates or fats, and provides guidelines for how to make healthy choices.

In addition, favorite comfort foods are subjected to the "Rx for Recipes" treatment, resulting in Updated Mac and Cheese, which substitutes whole-wheat pasta and low-fat cottage cheese and adds spinach, or Fettuccine Alfredo, which incorporates 1% milk and reduced fat cream cheese instead of cream. And vegetarian selections offer interesting, flavorful choices enhanced with fresh herbs and spices. Refreshingly, the "good carbs, good fats" subtitle is really just a hook that's explored only in the book's introduction.

While it can bring much relief, this simple statement does not preclude the need for practice. We must strive to always be aware of our Buddha nature, rather than waiting until times of emotional upheaval when it is more difficult to practice. <br><br>Thich Nhat Hanh uses the teachings of ninth century Zen Master Linji to elaborate on this simple truth and to give readers tools that can help awaken them to their true inner nature. Linji's recorded teachings are the most significant we have from the Ch'an school.<br><br>One of the unique aspects of Linji's teaching, is the need to "wake ourselves up," not only by means of sitting meditation and listening to enlightened teachings, but also through unique techniques such as the shout, the stick, and the empty fist. Master Linji emphasized direct experience of our true nature over intellectual explorations of the teachings, and he encouraged his students to not "become lost in the knowledge or the concepts of the teaching."<br><br>Powerful, direct, and uncompromising, Thich Nhat Hanh's reflections on the teachings of Master Linji are destined to become classic Buddhist writings.</p><p>In this fresh translation and commentary, Thich Nhat Hanh explores the essential teachings of Master Linji, one of the founders of Zen Buddhism. Linji's unorthodox teachings remind us that insight is better reached through our own experience and practice than by following others.<br><br>With humor, skill, and compassion, Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how we can each get closer to the ideals within us, and the person who simply is, with nothing to achieve and nowhere to be. <br>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today. His best-selling books include <i>Happiness</i> and <i>Peace Is Every Step</i>.

Followed by wolves, knocked down by a bus, confronted by bears, chased by a naked man with a gun and stranded with severe frostbite, Rosie's breathtaking 20,000-mile solo journey is as gripping as it is inspiring.</p> <p>Rosie's solo run around the world started out of sorrow and heartache and a wish to turn something around.</p> <p>Heartbroken when she lost her husband to cancer, Rosie set off from Wales with nothing but a small backpack of food and equipment, and funded by the rent from her little cottage. So began her epic 5-year journey that would take her 20,000 miles around the world, crossing Europe, Russia, Asia, Alaska, North America, Greenland, Iceland, and back into the UK.</p> <p>On a good day she'd run 30 miles, on a bad day she'd only manage 500 yards, digging herself out of the snow at -62 degrees C, moving her cart inches at a time. Every inch, every mile, was a triumph, a celebration of life, and 53 pairs of shoes later Rosie arrived home to jubilant crowds in Tenby, Wales.</p> <p>Rosie's incredible story is a mesmerizing page-turner of the run of her life. It will wake up the sleeping adventurer in you; it will inspire hope, courage and determination in you; but most of all it will convince you to live your life to the full and make every day count.</p></p><p><p>Rosie Swale Pope took up marathon running when she was 48 and has run across Cuba and Romania and even done the gruelling Marathon des Sables in the Sahara.

She's intelligent-she aced AP physics; athletic-a former state-ranked tennis doubles champion; and beautiful. She is, in short, everything her mother, Elizabeth, hoped she could be. The family's move to Landsdale, with stepfather James in tow, hadn't been as bumpy as Elizabeth feared. <br><br> But as the school year draws to a close, there are disturbing signs that the life Rosie claims to be leading is a sham, and that Elizabeth's hopes for her daughter to remain immune from the pull of the darker impulses of drugs and alcohol are dashed. Slowly and against their will, Elizabeth and James are forced to confront the fact that Rosie has been lying to them-and that her deceptions will have profound consequences. <br><br> This is Anne Lamott's most honest and heartrending novel yet, exploring our human quest for connection and salvation as it reveals the traps that can befall all of us.</p><p><b>Anne Lamott</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Help, Thanks, Wow; Small Victories; Stitches</i>;&nbsp;<i>Some Assembly Required</i>;&nbsp;<i>Grace (Eventually)</i>;&nbsp;<i>Plan B</i>;&nbsp;<i>Traveling Mercies; Bird by Bird</i>; <i>Operating Instructions</i>, and the forthcoming <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i>. She is also the author of several novels, including&nbsp;<i>Imperfect Birds&nbsp;</i>and <i>Rosie</i>. A past recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and an inductee to the California Hall of Fame, she lives in Northern California.The age-old conflict between parent and child takes a distinctly contemporary turn in Lamott&#39;s latest novel. Elizabeth, an emotionally fragile mother with a history of alcoholism, must help her daughter, Rosie, navigate similar perils. Susan Denaker&#39;s composed performance makes this family drama difficult to ignore. Rather than using overwrought tones to depict the friction between mother and daughter, Denaker devises distinct voices for each character and delivers them evenly, allowing for quieter, more likable characters--like the ironic James, Elizabeth&#39;s husband--to temper the strife. Denaker&#39;s calm adds depth to these relationships, and the manipulation and power struggles that go with them.

The great themes woven through this spirited narrative are inseparable from the author's own intellectual preoccupations: the fading of liberalism, the rise of populism and nationalism, the achievements and dangers of technology, and the continuing democratization of the globe.</p><p>The historical twentieth century began with the First World War in 1914 and ended seventy-five years later with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1989. The short century saw the end of European dominance and the rise of American power and influence throughout the world. The twentieth century was an American century--perhaps <i>the</i> American century. Lukacs explores in detail the phenomenon of national socialism (national socialist parties, he reminds us, have outlived the century), Hitler's sole responsibility for the Second World War, and the crucial roles played by his determined opponents Churchill and Roosevelt. Between 1939 and 1942 Germany came closer to winning than many people suppose.</p><p>Lukacs casts a hard eye at the consequences of the Second World War--the often misunderstood Soviet-American cold war--and at the shifting social and political developments in the Far and Middle East and elsewhere. In an eloquent closing meditation on the passing of the twentieth century, he reflects on the advance of democracy throughout the world and the limitations of human knowledge.</p></p><p>John Lukacs is Emeritus Professor of History at Chestnut Hill College and the author of numerous books, including <i>Five Days in London</i>.Compressed history as sharp and provocative as it is short...<b>Lukacs</b> begins with the start of World War I and closes with the belated end of the Cold War, consistently contending that the Soviet Union was overrated as a threat to the United States and American primacy. Some will take issue with how much this history focuses on Europe in general and the two world wars in particular...Yet the author has a solid point of view and requires readers to come to terms with it, whether they agree or not. Where other histories focus on larger economic, cultural and political forces, Lukacs stresses the crucial roles played by individuals...A masterpiece of concision and a marvel of clear, controlled prose. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i> 2013-04-15)<br><br><b>Lukacs</b> delivers an insightful overview of the 'historical' 20th century, a span beginning in 1914 with WWI and ending in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2013-07-01)<br><br>This readable and thought-provoking book is one of the first short histories of the 20th century that is more than a list of dates and facts.<br> (Leslie Lewis <i>Library Journal</i> 2013-09-15)<br><br>The 1920s, according to <b>Lukacs</b>, was the only true revolutionary decade of the last century--all that stuff we saw in the 1960s was merely &#x2018;further exaggerations&#x2019; of Roaring Twenties trends. That&#x2019;s the sort of arresting remark that makes the Hungarian-born American scholar one of the most idiosyncratic historians of his era...And he makes a thought-provoking case for the 20s as the fulcrum of modernity...There are many...swipes at conventional wisdom and prevailing assumptions in this engaging book...Most intriguing is Lukacs&#x2019;s conclusion as to what might be the 20th century&#x2019;s signal achievement. Advances in physics, tellingly accomplished in the revolutionary 1920s, demonstrated that observers are an inseparable part of what they observe. Humans have thus returned, metaphysically, to the center of the universe, something that will affect, unpredictably, our concept of ourselves for decades to come. (Brian Bethune <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i> 2013-10-31)<br><br>More an interpretation than a history. But what an interpretation! To <b>Lukacs</b>, communism and anti-communism were blips on the historical radar. Russia has always been a giant authoritarian despotism, as has China--whether the autocrats of these states call themselves &#x2018;communist&#x2019; or not has little to do with overall conditions there. This insistence is the most refreshing aspect of the book--rather than viewing politics as a perpetual crisis, where the existence of life as we know it is threatened with each presidential campaign, Lukacs insists that nations will, generally speaking, continue to keep their fundamental character. (Caleb Nelson <i>World Magazine</i> 2013-12-14)<br><br>Impressive...[A] fascinating book...[<b>Lukacs</b>&#x2019;s] book focuses on the century&#x2019;s powerful nations, leaders, and ideas...Generally, he views material factors as less important than the human mind in shaping history. (Geoffrey Blaine <i>Australian Book Review</i> 2014-02-01)<br><br>A cultural pessimist, an erudite historian and a humanist, <b>Lukacs</b> does not mince his words when he explores the follies of a century second to none in terms of mass delusions, violence and state-organized terror. Insightful, unorthodox and unpredictable, the book offers new perspectives on communism, fascism, liberal democracy and nationalism. His discussion of communism as rooted in fear is truly original.

The mottled face &#x2013; the mouth half open as though she is trying, one more time, to take a breath &#x2013; still has traces of unformed childhood around the jaw. Blonde hair, blown and flicked up. Giant hoop earrings. Eyes made huge by half a pot of electric-blue eyeshadow, glitter gel spangling the naked <i>d�colletage</i>. Platform boots, improbable in the angles they form with the mirrored floor.</p><p>She&#x2019;s been at Stardust, thinks Amber. Saturday. It&#x2019;s Seventies night at Stardust.</p><p>She feels sick. Glances behind her through the open door and sees that the concourse is empty. As though all her colleagues have dropped off the edge of the world.</p><p>She steps inside and closes the door to block out the light. Doesn&#x2019;t want anyone else to see. Not yet. Not while shock has ripped her mask away.</p><p>Thank God I&#x2019;m wearing rubber gloves, she thinks nonsensically. She has cleaned the place every night for the past three years and, however careful she is, her fingerprints will be all over it. Let alone the prints of half the visitors who&#x2019;ve passed through since this time last night. They try to keep the smudges down by handing out disposable plastic gloves on the door, but you can&#x2019;t actually force someone to wear them; can&#x2019;t police the interior 24/7.</p><p>Innfinnityland is the only attraction Amber cleans herself, since her promotion. The place makes everyone uneasy, as though they are afraid that they will get lost and never find their way back, or that the mirrors themselves are infected with ghosts. Too many times the work, which needs to be autistically methodical, has been rushed and skimped, and smears have remained; and in a place like this, a single smear becomes an infinite number, the original hard to track down if you&#x2019;re not working your way through, fingertip by fingertip, glass by glass. She decided long ago that it was easiest simply to do it herself. Wishes fervently now that she hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>The girl has green eyes, like Amber&#x2019;s own. Her handbag &#x2013;mock-croc &#x2013; has fallen open and scattered poignant remnants of plans made, hopes cherished. A lipstick, a bottle of JLo, a pink phone with a metallic charm shaped like a stiletto court shoe . . .breezy statements of identity, turned tawdry beneath their owner&#x2019;s glassy stare.</p><p>There is no blood. Just the impression of squeezing fingers livid on her neck. This is the third one this year, Amber thinks. It can&#x2019;t be a coincidence. Two is coincidence; three is . . . oh, you poor child.</p><p>Amber is cold to the bone, though the night is warm. She edges her way forward slowly, like an old person, one shaking hand supporting her against the mirrors as she moves. As she advances, new reflections cross her sight line: a million corpses strewn across a hall of infinite size.</p><p>Then suddenly, herself. Face white, eyes large, mouth a thin line. Standing above the body like Lady Macbeth.</p><p>What were you going to do? Touch her?</p><p>The thought freezes her to the spot. She&#x2019;s not been thinking. Shock has turned her into a creature of instinct, an automaton. Has made her forgetful.</p><p>What are you doing? You can&#x2019;t be involved. You can&#x2019;t. Anonymous. You&#x2019;re meant to be anonymous. Get involved, they&#x2019;ll work it out. Who you are. And once they know who you are...</p><p>She feels panic start up inside. The edgy tingle, the queasy itch. Familiar, never far from the surface. She needs to decide quickly.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t be the one to find her.</p><p>She begins to back away. Feels her way back to the entrance. The dead girl gazes at infinity. Damn you, Amber thinks, suddenly angry. Why did you have to get yourself killed here? What are you even doing here, anyway? It&#x2019;s been closed for hours. The park&#x2019;s been closed for hours.</p><p>She catches her own thoughts and lets out a barking, ironic laugh. &#x2018;Shit,&#x2019; she says out loud. &#x2018;Oh God, what am I meant to do?&#x2019;</p><p>Go and find help. Do what anyone would do, Amber. Go out there and act the way you feel: shocked and scared. No one&#x2019;s going to ask questions. There&#x2019;s someone killing girls in this town, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;ll recognise who <i>you</i> are.</p><p>But they&#x2019;ll take your photo. You know what the press are like. Anything to fill their pages; details to make up for lack of facts. You&#x2019;ll be all over the papers as the woman who found the body.</p><p><i>I can&#x2019;t do this. </i></p><p>Someone tries the entrance door, the sudden noise of the handle turning uselessly making her jump. She hears Jackie and Moses: Jackie chattering and flirting, Moses responding in monosyllables, but the smile clear in his voice.</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s always in here,&#x2019; says Jackie. &#x2018;After tea break. Amber? You in there? The door&#x2019;s locked!&#x2019;</p><p>Amber holds her breath, afraid that even the sound of her exhalation will call to them. Oh God, what do I do? I&#x2019;ve got to get out of here.</p><p>&#x2018;C&#x2019;mon,&#x2019; says Jackie. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s try the back. Maybe she&#x2019;s taking a break.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Sure,&#x2019; says Moses.</p><p>That&#x2019;s it, there&#x2019;s no escape now. She hears their footsteps recede down the steps as they walk off towards the entrance to the service alley. Two minutes before they get here, maybe. She can&#x2019;t get away, can&#x2019;t undo the moment of discovery.</p><p>She straightens up, steps over the girl&#x2019;s marionette legs and hurries to the emergency exit hidden behind the black curtain beyond. Best they find her out on the steps, out in the fresh air, throwing up.</p></p><h2>A Treatise on White Magic: Or the Way of the Disciple</h2><p>2012 Reprint of 1945 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. &#34;A Treatise on White Magic&#34; is considered to be one of her most important writings, as it is less abstract than most, and deals with many important subjects of her works in an introductory, even programmatic fashion. It was first published in 1934 with the subtitle &#39;The Way of the Disciple&#39;. She promulgated White Magic as a discipline to serve humanity. Bailey said the work was dictated telepathically by the Tibetan Master, Djwal Khul. It is offered as a &#34;basic textbook&#34; for the Western aspirant to initiation, and is divided into fifteen rules of magic, each one taking the reader further into the mysteries of spirituality. Topics discussed include: how an aspirant can best prepare himself for service, the various ray types of their influences, the relationship between the macrocosm and microcosm, the spiritual, causal, astral and physical realms and their interactions, the spiritual psychology of man (although this is dealt with much more fully in the Esoteric Psychology volumes), The Hierarchy of Masters, esoteric groups and schools, the spiritual centers (or chakras), the occult concept of the Seven Rays, meditation work and much more. One of the main themes is that of soul control. Students of the works of Alice A. Bailey and Theosophy believe that the ultimate purpose of White Magic is furtherance of the spiritual and material evolution of humanity. Specifically, this evolution is conceived in terms of the increased benevolent manifestation of seven spiritual energies or Seven Rays. It is further believed that adept practitioners of White Magic, wielding the power of the Seven Rays, can contribute to this evolution.</p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>Tank Girl: Color Classics Book 1 1988-1990 (Tank Girl Colour Classics)</h2><p><b>The definitive anthology of Tank Girl collecting classic stories from original creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett!</b><br><br>The first volume in a new collection of classic Tank Girl comics from the legends Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett.

Anne Perry lives in Los Angeles.chapter<br><br>1<br><br>Monk sat beside the fire and felt the heat seep through him. Outside was the kind of clinging silence that only fog brings. The river was shrouded, and dusk came early this time of the year. Monk was unusually conscious of being happy. This deep sense of peace was not a casual thing. He looked at Hester in the chair opposite him and found himself smiling.<br><br>He was not aware of the first knock on the door. It was only when Hester stood up that he realized what the sound had been. He rose quickly. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d; Reluctantly, he went into the hall and unlocked the front door.<br><br>Sir Oliver Rathbone stood on the step, the porch light glistening on droplets of fog that covered his gray hat and the shoulders of his coat. His lean face was without its usual aura of wit.<br><br>There was no wind at all, and yet a breath of chill accompanied him.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; Monk said quickly, stepping back to allow him room.<br><br>Rathbone obeyed and pulled the door closed behind him. He shivered, as if suddenly aware of how cold he was. He took off his hat and coat and hung them on the hall stand, stuffing his gloves in his pockets.<br><br>&#x201c;It must be bad,&#x201d; Monk said. They had known each other for years&#x2014;in fact, for nearly all of the fifteen years since the Crimean War had ended in 1856. There was no need for social niceties.<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Rathbone replied. He both worked and lived on the north side of the Thames, so for him to have crossed the river to visit Monk at home meant the issue could not wait, even just until morning.<br><br>Monk led the way to the sitting room and opened the door into the warmth.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Rathbone said to Hester. They, too, had known each other long and well. Rathbone had met her when she was a nurse, newly home from the Crimea and still believing she could change the world of medical treatment and its attitude toward nursing, and women in medicine in general. That seemed like a long time ago now. But the cause, even now, was hardly begun.<br><br>&#x201c;You look frozen,&#x201d; she said with understanding. &#x201c;Tea?&#x201d; Then she reconsidered. &#x201c;Whisky?&#x201d;<br><br>Rathbone smiled very slightly. &#x201c;No, thank you. I need to keep a clear head.&#x201d; He turned to Monk. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m intruding, but it can&#x2019;t wait . . .&#x201d; He sat down in one of the chairs next to the fire.<br><br>Hester said nothing, but she prepared to listen intently.<br><br>Monk merely nodded and took the seat opposite Rathbone.<br><br>&#x201c;A man came to me an hour or two ago in a state of extreme distress.&#x201d; Rathbone&#x2019;s expression reflected his own understanding of pain. &#x201c;His wife has been kidnapped. Her life is forfeit if he does not pay a ransom, which is a fortune. He is a wealthy man, and has succeeded in raising the amount&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When was she taken?&#x201d; Monk interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;I know what you must be thinking,&#x201d; Rathbone replied with a bleak smile. &#x201c;How did he raise the money so quickly? Unless he had it in a safe somewhere, this would not have been possible. She was taken yesterday, which, if you remember, was actually a beautiful day for this time of year. He was given until tomorrow, at about this time. The exchange is to take place&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why the devil didn&#x2019;t he report it immediately?&#x201d; Monk interrupted him.<br><br>&#x201c;He intends to pay. What he wants of us is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Us?&#x201d; Monk cut across him again. &#x201c;If he wants the police, he should have gone to the regular London police, and yesterday, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, when the trail was hot!&#x201d;<br><br>Rathbone shook his head. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t. She was taken from the riverbank, which makes it your area. And the ransom is to be paid on Jacob&#x2019;s Island, which&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know what it is!&#x201d; Even though several years had passed since that bleak case, Monk shivered involuntarily at the memories the name &#x201c;Jacob&#x2019;s Island&#x201d; conjured in his imagination. He could still see the fat man sinking slowly into the tidal ooze, his mouth open, screaming, until the mud cut him off, and inch by inch he disappeared from sight. His body had never been found.<br><br>Monk came back to the moment: to the firelight, to Hester, now sitting and leaning toward him, concern in her face; to the lamplight on Rathbone&#x2019;s hair, which had more silver in it than before. Jacob&#x2019;s Island was one of the worst slums in London. On the river&#x2019;s edge, it was not literally an island, but a region of interconnecting waterways with old offices and wharfs. The warehouses built upon them were sinking slowly into their foundations as they rotted away and collapsed one on top of another. Jacob&#x2019;s Island could be reached by land across one bridge, and by water through several landing piers.<br><br>&#x201c;He wants the River Police to go with him to the exchange, the payment for his wife&#x2019;s&#x2014;Kate Exeter&#x2019;s&#x2014;life,&#x201d; Rathbone said quietly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all he came about. He doesn&#x2019;t expect you to catch the kidnappers, or to save the money, just to see that the exchange is made, and he and Kate leave there safely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kate Exeter?&#x201d; Monk turned the name over in his mind. There was something familiar about it, but he could not place it.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry Exeter,&#x201d; Rathbone said. &#x201c;His first wife died. Kate is his second. About twenty years younger than he. He&#x2019;s devoted to her.&#x201d; Compassion showed in Rathbone&#x2019;s face. He himself had married a second time, only recently. He had a happiness he had never believed possible, after the disappointment of his first marriage, followed by bitter loneliness. Rathbone knew how exquisitely precious happiness was, and how fragile. He tried not to think of the possibility of losing it again, but it was clear in his eyes, in the strain of his position, that his empathy with Harry Exeter was based in his own emotions, not imagination.<br><br>Monk did not need explanations. &#x201c;So, he spent yesterday and today getting the money,&#x201d; he concluded.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He has nearly all of it, and his assurance of the rest tomorrow. It&#x2019;s the price of five good-sized London family houses, in a decent area,&#x201d; Rathbone replied. &#x201c;I came to you tonight because Exeter&#x2019;s in my chambers now. I want you to meet him. Get all the information you can. You&#x2019;ll need tomorrow to plan. He has to hand over the money himself. It&#x2019;s part of the bargain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And bringing the police into it?&#x201d; The consequences of even one slip were appalling.<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Rathbone said gravely. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s allowed to have at least one man go with him. He insisted on that. He doesn&#x2019;t know the place, and he pointed out that alone in an area like that, carrying a bag full of money, he&#x2019;d be lucky if he made it as far as the agreed rendezvous spot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t they pick some reasonable place?&#x201d; Monk asked, but already he knew the answer. Jacob&#x2019;s Island was a warren that the ordinary Londoner would be utterly lost in, frightened, disoriented, always afraid of the rising tide. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come and meet him,&#x201d; he said before Rathbone could answer him. He stood up. &#x201c;Get all the information I can. Tomorrow I&#x2019;ll choose my men and speak to them. Some of them know Jacob&#x2019;s Island fairly well. Although the damn place is changing all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>Rathbone stood as well. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; He turned to Hester. &#x201c;I apologize,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but it should all be over after tomorrow night. Exeter will be considerably poorer, but his wife will be safe, even if she does have nightmares for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They pass,&#x201d; Hester said ruefully.<br><br>Monk looked at her, concerned. She had been kidnapped not so long ago. He could recall her waking in the night, gasping, fighting the blankets, once even weeping uncontrollably. He had held her close, assuring her. And now she was thinking of this woman who had been kidnapped and was waiting, terrified, perhaps on Jacob&#x2019;s Island, trusting her husband could and would pay the ransom.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get her back safely,&#x201d; Monk promised. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the money they want. And thank God Exeter seems to have it, and is willing to pay.&#x201d; He glanced out the window. It was dark outside now. The fog smothered everything.<br><br>Hester smiled. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s as lucky as I was, the kidnappers will be caught as well. Go now! Poor Exeter will be frantic with worry. Assure him, as much as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled and leaned forward to kiss her quickly on the cheek. Her skin was warm, soft as always, and he inhaled the fragrance of her hair.<br><br>Rathbone was already waiting at the front door, his hat and coat on. He undid the latch, grimaced as he saw the fog was thicker than before, and stepped out into it. Monk followed after him, his coat on, too, though he still felt the damp cling to him immediately. He closed the door behind him and heard Hester lock it. He followed Rathbone down the familiar path to the street. By the time he reached it and looked back, the house was already swallowed up in the thick darkness.<br><br>From somewhere down the river a foghorn gave its long, mournful cry. There was no other sound. Even their footfalls were muffled on the pavement.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be no ferries over the river,&#x201d; Monk remarked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to see if we can find a hansom on Union Street. The Rotherhithe road is right on the water, and it&#x2019;ll be even thicker there.&#x201d;<br><br>Rathbone fell in step with him without commenting. The nearest bridge was a stiff walk from where they were, and Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, where Rathbone&#x2019;s chambers were, was a good deal farther than that.<br><br>It was half an hour before they found a cab, almost on the bridge. They heard the horse&#x2019;s hoofs on the cobbles, muffled by the distorted echoes. It was almost upon them before they saw its lamps approaching. Monk stepped into the street and caught the horse&#x2019;s bridle, bringing it to a stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; the driver shouted, fear sharpening his voice as he raised his whip.<br><br>Monk saw the shadow of the whip before it could strike him. &#x201c;Police!&#x201d; He moved forward, allowing his face to be seen, if dimly, in the small circle of light. &#x201c;We need a ride to Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, please. Double fare.&#x201d;<br><br>The driver grunted. &#x201c;Up front?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Monk fished in his pocket, and Rathbone did the same. They handed over the coins gratefully and climbed inside.<br><br>It still took them nearly three-quarters of an hour. Rathbone&#x2019;s chambers were all lit, and his clerk opened the door before Rathbone had time to ring the bell.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you tea, sir,&#x201d; the clerk said. &#x201c;And a couple of sandwiches. Would cold beef be satisfactory?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be perfect,&#x201d; Rathbone said warmly.<br><br>&#x201c;I already took the liberty of serving Mr. Exeter, sir. He doesn&#x2019;t look well, poor man.&#x201d;<br><br>Rathbone thanked him and led the way to his own suite of rooms. He opened the door, Monk on his heels.<br><br>Immediately a man standing at the hearth turned to face them. He was above average height. His thick, fair hair was liberally sprinkled with gray, visible mostly at the temples. Monk guessed he would have been good-looking, were he not frantically worried, his skin slick with sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;Monk?&#x201d; he asked, stepping forward. &#x201c;Are you the commander of the Thames River Police?&#x201d; Without waiting for an answer, he grasped Monk&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Thank you for coming. It&#x2019;s a filthy night, I know. But this can&#x2019;t wait. I am Harry Exeter . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m Monk.&#x201d; He took the man&#x2019;s hand briefly. &#x201c;Rathbone told me about your situation.&#x201d;<br><br>Exeter was shaking, in spite of the warmth of the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got almost all the money. I&#x2019;m picking up the rest tomorrow. I have to be the one to hand it over. Don&#x2019;t argue with me about that. They insisted. Kate . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t argue with you, Mr. Exeter,&#x201d; Monk assured him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to know as much as you can tell me. That&#x2019;s the best we can do tonight. Tell me what you know, and what you suspect. If you have ideas of who could be behind this. And, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, sit down, man! Clear your head as much as you can. I have some idea how you feel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can you?&#x201d; Exeter asked, his voice raised as if a sudden fury moved him. &#x201c;How can you possibly know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because my wife was kidnapped a little while ago. I was lucky, I got her back. And we&#x2019;ll do everything possible to get your wife back,&#x201d; Monk replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . .&#x201d; Exeter looked at the floor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I . . . didn&#x2019;t think. When something like this happens, you feel so helpless . . . so alone. Everyone else looks safe, and you . . . you don&#x2019;t think anyone else can know how you feel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. I felt desperate, too. But we got her back safely.&#x201d;<br><br>Exeter searched his face, as if trying to judge how much of what Monk said was true, how much an attempt to calm him.<br><br>Monk gave him a brief, tight smile. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Mr. Exeter, your wife will be returned to you before we do anything to catch the kidnappers. Have you any idea who they are or why it was she who was taken? Any enemies?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kate? Never!&#x201d; he said vehemently.<br><br>&#x201c;I meant you . . . your enemies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh! Yes, I suppose so. Every successful man makes enemies. I&#x2019;m good at what I do. When I win a contract, it necessarily means that someone else loses. But that&#x2019;s business. I lose, sometimes. I don&#x2019;t hate the man who wins. I learn from it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If anything comes to your mind, do let me know,&#x201d; Monk dismissed the subject. &#x201c;Now tell me what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kate had luncheon with her cousin, Celia Darwin. They are quite close. It was a lovely day, if you remember, nothing like today. They walked along the riverbank in the afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where, exactly?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Over Chelsea Bridge, and then along Battersea Park&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Were there many people about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose so. I really don&#x2019;t know. Celia was distraught! Poor woman felt as if it were somehow her fault. I couldn&#x2019;t get a lot of sense out of her. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. We can ask your wife when we get her back. What did Celia say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That a young man came up and asked the way, then started some sort of conversation. Celia&#x2019;s attention was diverted, and the next moment a group of people came by and Celia and Kate were separated, and when the newcomers were gone, Kate was, too . . . and so was the young man. She thought at first it was nothing, just silliness, but then when Kate didn&#x2019;t come back, she grew frightened and called for help. The police came, but there was no sign of Kate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The police looked for her?&#x201d;<br><br>Exeter&#x2019;s expression filled with a mixture of anger and desperation. He seemed to be trying everything he could to keep his voice steady. &#x201c;One pretty young woman, one plain one. A young man who apparently was handsome.&#x201d; He spread his hands helplessly. &#x201c;They drew their own conclusions. Celia told them Kate was married, and would never do such a thing. Celia was so upset. She is plain and older, and she has a pronounced limp. They thought she was feeling alone, unwanted, and they didn&#x2019;t believe her. They intended to reassure her, but they only ended up insulting her.&#x201d;</p><h2>Queen of the Sea</h2><p><b>Cult graphic novelist Dylan Meconis offers a rich reimagining of history in this beautifully detailed hybrid novel loosely based on the exile of Queen Elizabeth I by her sister, Queen Mary.</b><br><br>When her sister seizes the throne, Queen Eleanor of Albion is banished to a tiny island off the coast of her kingdom, where the nuns of the convent spend their days peacefully praying, sewing, and gardening. But the island is also home to Margaret, a mysterious young orphan girl whose life is upturned when the cold, regal stranger arrives. As Margaret grows closer to Eleanor, she grapples with the revelation of the island&#x2019;s sinister true purpose as well as the truth of her own past. When Eleanor&#x2019;s life is threatened, Margaret is faced with a perilous choice between helping Eleanor and protecting herself.

But they can cope with change and thrive by creating a culture that supports positive pushback: questioning everything without disrespecting anyone.<br><br>Nigel Travis has forty years of experience as a leader in large and successful organizations, as well as those facing existential crisis-such as Blockbuster as it dawdled in the face of the Netflix challenge. In his ten years as CEO and chairman of Dunkin' Brands, Travis fine-tuned his ideas about the challenge culture and perfected the practices required to build it. He argues that the best way for organizations to succeed in today's environment is to embrace challenge and encourage pushback. Everyone-from the new recruit to the senior leader-must be given the freedom to speak up and question the status quo, must learn how to talk in a civil way about difficult issues, and should be encouraged to debate strategies and tactics-although always in the spirit of shared purpose. How else will new ideas emerge? How else can organizations steadily improve?<br><br>Through colorful storytelling, with many examples from his own career-including his leadership in turning around the fear-ridden culture of the London-based Leyton Orient Football Club, of which he is part owner-Travis shows how to establish a culture that welcomes challenge, achieves exceptional results, and ensures a prosperous future.<br><br></p><p><b>Nigel Travis</b>, the chairman of Dunkin' Brands, was the company's chief executive officer from 2009 through 2018. His distinctive human-centered perspective on leadership and management, now viewed as essential in today's complex and diverse global organizations, took root early in his career when he was a human resources manager."Business and politics have become ever more competitive and unpredictable. In order to succeed in this environment, Travis introduces <i>The Challenge Culture</i> where employees are encouraged and are sufficiently self-confident to push back, engage in debate, and, along with their leaders, search intensively for the best answer to critical issues. A must-read for all people leading organizations in these turbulent times!"&#x2015;<b><i><b>Larry Bossidy</b>, retired chairman and CEO of Honeywell International, coauthor of <i>Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done</i></i></b><br><br>"A culture built on open dialogue and honesty will deliver collective positive outcomes for customers and team members."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Catherine D'Amato</b>, president and CEO, The Greater Boston Food Bank</i></b><br><br>"What a wonderful read, with terrific, memorable thoughts, and a powerful theme: what is essential for a successful business is the ability to question the leadership and ask 'why?'. There are more lessons to be learned than offered by any Harvard MBA."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jack Cowin</b>, chairman and managing director, Competitive Foods Australia Ltd</i></b><br><br>"Nigel understands the intricacies of everything. And, even better, he knows how to put them together to make a business run the way it should. This book not only takes you inside his businesses, but inside the mind that challenged them to thrive. If you can use 20 percent of what he's suggesting, you'll be ahead of the game. Use 40 percent and you can blow the doors off."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Mark Goldstein</b>, former chief marketing officer, BBDO Worldwide</i></b><br><br>"<i>The Challenge Culture</i> is a must-read for those wanting to improve their leadership skills in light of a fast changing social and political workplace environment. Nigel implores all of us to foster an open and engaging culture of challenge. For over three decades, Nigel has been at the helm of internationally recognizable organizations, and the insights of <i>The Challenge Culture</i> provide a powerful playbook for people across the business world."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Sam Kennedy</b>, president and CEO of the Boston Red Sox</i></b><br><br>"We all know that America <i>runs</i> on Dunkin', but have you ever wondered how Dunkin' runs? Dunkin' Brands chairman and CEO Nigel Travis has experience running some of the nation's largest franchises and shares his insight on the importance of creating a challenge culture, one that questions the status quo, encourages internal pushback, and helps companies be nimble enough to adapt to change. <i>The Challenge Culture</i> is a must-read for employers and employees alike, and promises to get ideas for long-term success percolating."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Robert Kraft</b>, chairman and CEO of the Kraft Group and The New England Patriots</i></b><br><br>"Nigel Travis has been at the top of major maverick enterprises which missed moments for vital re-invention as well as those which seized the moment for needed transformation. I knew Bill Rosenberg, the visionary founder of Dunkin' Donuts, well and he'd have loved the challenge culture Travis helped inspire there today. Dissent is not disloyalty but can be the spark for innovation and the safeguard for integrity. Firms from the governance financial frauds of Enron and Worldcom to the privacy and gender 'bro cultures' at today's tech titans would have benefited from Travis' leadership lessons. Conformity kills creativity and subverts justice and <i>The Challenge Culture</i> is the antidote to a contagion of conformity across sectors."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jeffrey A.

It's the permission you give others&#x2014;and yourself&#x2014;to forgive a debt, to absolve the unabsolvable, to let go of the judgment and pain that make life so difficult.<br><br>In <i>Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy</i>&nbsp;Lamott ventures to explore where to find meaning in life. We should begin, she suggests, by "facing a great big mess, especially the great big mess of ourselves." It's up to each of us to recognize the presence and importance of mercy everywhere&#x2014;"within us and outside us, all around us"&#x2014;and to use it to forge a deeper understanding of ourselves and more honest connections with each other. While that can be difficult to do, Lamott argues that it's crucial, as "kindness towards others, beginning with myself, buys us a shot at a warm and generous heart, the greatest prize of all."&nbsp;<br><br>Full of Lamott&#x2019;s trademark honesty, humor and forthrightness, <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i> is profound and caring, funny and wise&#x2014;a hopeful book of hands-on spirituality.<b><br><br></b></p><p><b>Anne Lamott</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of <i>Hallelujah Anyway;</i> <i>Help, Thanks, Wow; Small Victories; Stitches</i>;&nbsp;<i>Some Assembly Required</i>;&nbsp;<i>Grace (Eventually)</i>;&nbsp;<i>Plan B</i>;&nbsp;<i>Traveling Mercies; Bird by Bird</i>; and<i> Operating Instructions</i>.

Good and bad things happen to good and bad people. That&#x2019;s not much of a system: a better one would be a silverware drawer for joy, sorrows, doldrums, madness, ease. But no, Eden explodes and we enter a dangerous, terrifying world, the same place where goodness, love, and kind intelligence lift us so often. The world has an awful beauty. This is a chaotic place, humanity is a chaotic place, and I am a chaotic place.<br> Mother Nature is the main problem. Mother Nature runs on the principle that we all just get killed.<br><br>This is a little depressing, that nearly every species has to be afraid in order to live. Of course it makes sense for a colony of wild rabbits to be afraid when the harrier hawk appears overhead; no surprise that you hear the concerned back- ground music swell from the bushes. But I&#x2019;ve seen toothy foxes up close on my hikes, and they bolt. They really don&#x2019;t seem interested in getting to know me. (Their loss.) They&#x2019;re afraid of an older woman with sore feet and hands, because life is scary.<br><br>How&#x2014;if we are to believe that there is meaning in our brief time here on earth, that mercy is the ground of our being, and love is sovereign&#x2014; do we explain childhood cancer, earthquakes, addiction? Where is mercy in a beloved&#x2019;s suicide? In the Christian tradition, we say that Christ continues to be crucified, in tsunamis, sick children, political prisoners, and that we must respond.<br><br>This is what I believe, so I show up and get water for people, real people, which is to say, annoying people. Mother Teresa cradling strangers at dawn is very romantic, but in life, there&#x2019;s also your thirsty bigoted father, your lying sister, the whole human race, living and dying and rising with Christ.<br><br>In the rabbinical tradition, there is great insight in the notion that when we see suffering, we remember that this is only the sixth day. We&#x2019;re not done here. The good news is that God isn&#x2019;t, either. God is searching with us for a cure for cancer. God rejoiced at the cure for smallpox.<br><br>And the Dalai Lama said, &#x201c;Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t love hearing this, but yes: yes, one of these days I&#x2019;m going to die. However, not on any of all the other days. Today, we put on the artist&#x2019;s smock and plug back in.<br><br>This co-creation goes slowly. Time takes time. It&#x2019;s about evolution, increased equal rights side by side with mothers still hauling in their daughters to the traditional surgeon for genital mutilation. The great French Jesuit soul Teilhard de Chardin believed we&#x2019;re on the crest of a wave, evolving toward what I would dare to call, this one time, Christ consciousness; but chaos is real and hard and a lot of people would be relieved to live in the silverware drawer of North Korea, if there was more food.<br><br>One of the few consolations is that it is not just you and yours who get upset and scared and deeply defeated, not just your own rabbi or lama who loses faith occasionally and sinks into despair. It is everyone. Even Jesus&#x2019; best friends lost hope, even with Him right there beside them, way before the crucifixion.<br><br>When Jesus comforts Mary and Martha after the death of their brother, Lazarus, we read the shortest and most amazing line of the Bible: Jesus wept. But in some translations it says Jesus is pissed. And the reason for this pisses me off: He&#x2019;s sad because Lazarus dies, but He&#x2019;s also frustrated because Mary and Martha aren&#x2019;t getting the message&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t fully believe in the kingdom right then. Right then, after their brother has died. Martha is despondent that Jesus didn&#x2019;t rush to Bethany to save him, since He could have done so, and Mary worries that her brother&#x2019;s body will smell after four days dead in the tomb. Well, yeah. You can hardly blame her. They are the ultimate believers, and yet everything feels awful. And how does Jesus react? He gets pissy.<br><br> The women remind me of my pastor&#x2019;s sermon on dual citizenship. She described the in- formation in one of our spiritual passports&#x2014;that we&#x2019;re beautiful children, created by, and made of, holiness, spirit, love. In the other passport, regrettably, we have bodies, biographies, minds, and personalities. Mary and Martha have come so far in their faith, in trust and surrender, but it&#x2019;s not enough for Jesus. He admonishes them, and this bugs me. He wants them to come all the way into faith. He&#x2019;s saying, Okay, so the shit has hit the fan&#x2014;do you still believe that I am the Resurrection and the Life? Even when you don&#x2019;t get what you want? Even when nothing makes sense?<br><br> I&#x2019;m sorry, but I&#x2019;m with the sisters here&#x2014;and all inconsolable believers.<br><br> Jesus wants to know why they can&#x2019;t believe that their brother is still in His perfect care, safe and whole, and even smelling good, no matter what things look like. If Jesus were sitting here with me, in a good mood, I would say to Him, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started.&#x201d; Jesus deliberately let their brother die, that the prophecies might be fulfilled. Putting aside that this is a morally ambiguous decision&#x2014;whatever happened to the shepherd&#x2019;s desolation at one missing sheep?&#x2014;they responded in authentic human ways, with weeping, anger, shock, and doubt.<br><br>There is so much for Jesus to be pissy about, but this? I believe God loves the real, is the real, who loves us at our most genuine, unburnished, unarmored. But Jesus groans. Oy vey.<br><br>The sisters, in their shock, say, We&#x2019;re suffering, scared, and hate everything, and we&#x2019;re not sure what is true anymore. And Jesus doesn&#x2019;t hear their humanity. He corrects them. Keep the faith, He says: I really am the god of the quick and the dead. Then, like a slightly depressive cheerleader, He tells them, Go big.<br><br>Now, I believe in a kingdom of heaven within, and that the soul never dies, but you take away my brothers, my son, or my grandson, and we have a problem on our hands. Wouldn&#x2019;t you think God&#x2019;s embrace of me in despair is galactic? And these women, with a lifelong lack of stature, and messy female bodies, have been derided enough.<br><br>When the rock at the entrance to Lazarus&#x2019;s tomb is rolled back, and Jesus calls for Lazarus to come out, Lazarus does. He walks out wrapped in grave clothes, not looking, feeling, or probably smelling his very best; it is still a miracle, maybe in need of a shower. And when he dies again later, the sisters still got their miracle. So it all works out.<br><br>Orson Welles said, &#x201c;If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.&#x201d; The crucifixion looked like a big win for the Romans. At the end of the Lazarus story, the four are together again, Jesus and the family, and I can see here that mercy means that no one bolted. Mercy means, I don&#x2019;t run away from this, and go shopping, just because you and your smelly family disappoint me. I stay.<br><br>I am committed to this, to this supernatural love. But Jesus pissy? I ask you.<br><br>Of course He wins me back right away. My Sunday school loves the story of Jesus&#x2019; returning after the resurrection, to the beach where his desolate disciples are grieving his death. As Frederick Buechner wrote, &#x201c;The darkness . . . is broken by the f licker of a charcoal f ire on the sand. Jesus has made it. He cooks some fish on it for his old friends&#x2019; breakfast. On the horizon there are the first pale traces of the sun getting ready to rise.&#x201d; He cooked them brunch! It&#x2019;s so cool; my kids and I toast Him with juice boxes.<br> I&#x2019;ve lived through times when a connected group of humans in grief and shock stayed together as things unscrolled, when a person was dying too young, or after. What could we do? We showed up. When our best friends&#x2019; teenagers disappeared, when their fathers lost their minds, or their babies or mates were in the ICU. We lay beside them in bed and held them in our arms. We brought the bereaved a sandwich. We let them vent, maybe watched a little TV together. We offered our presence, our warm bodies, and the willingness to feel like shit with them. One even bigger gift: no snappy answers. We could nod, sigh, cry with them; maybe go to a park. Against all odds, these things work, however imperfectly, when a closed system breaks open and turmoil ensues: this collective, imperfect, hesitant help is another kind of miracle.<br><br>Naturally one wants to avoid these kinds of miracles. We&#x2019;d prefer routine, predictability, to never be ashamed or afraid, let alone aghast. But comfort zones leak. A niece dies, or there&#x2019;s an earthquake, a lesion appears, affairs happen. If anyone is so good that he or she should be spared, you can safely assume that person is in the line of f ire. Fair is where the pony rides are. In lovely closed systems, timers are set: tick tick tick.<br><br>The belief in original sin made sense of the chaos and pain by saying that we had caused it through sin, but this does not have the ring of truth for some of us, especially with sick or starving children. What has the ring of truth is this: It sucks.<br><br>You can say that certain tragic events are unfair and humiliating, but really, they are just true. Randomness and brutality are just what is; but so is mercy.<br><br>The power of mercy came clear to me recently, when the son of one of my closest friends, Ann, took his own life. He shot himself at a beach near the house where he had been staying with his aged mother for nearly a year. Everyone had seen suicide looming for a long time, and yet it was still the end of the world. Ann, at ninety- two, had lost her younger son.<br><br>It&#x2019;s stunning, how a great trauma can also be so ordinary. Some of the dearest and most brilliant people we&#x2019;ve known were not able to bear life on this planet, and we were unable to save them. Where, in the aftermath of suicide, does one even begin to believe in mercy again?<br><br>There were four people whose presence brought Ann comfort in the first few days, and we were there at all times in the first week. What I saw was the extremely disorganized nature of life, the reality of suicide, charity, sacrifice. We mourned Jay&#x2019;s death, felt joy in his deep good- ness, relief at his escape, and we felt Ann&#x2019;s shaky peace. She was thankful that she&#x2019;d been able to spend so much time with her son in the last ten months, not to mention fifty years. She said that she could still feel his presence off and on, and experience peace that he had left her and his big brother and his kids notes of assurance and love. She experienced relief and gratitude that he had not shot himself at their home. And she missed him as only a mother can.<br><br>People kept saying she would feel him again someday, and she said, &#x201c;Oh, I feel him now.&#x201d; Lifelong friends told her she really must take a nap, and she said, nicely, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not tired.&#x201d; We brought the few foods she could handle, peaches, avocados, cheese, cherries, and people suggested she probably needed more protein. People said that since Jay was in a closed casket, awaiting cremation, there was no reason for us to visit the funeral home, but we did. We sat with him for a long time, not knowing at which end of the casket his head was, or his feet, so Ann rubbed the cloth at one end while I rubbed the cloth at the other. Then, smiling, we switched places.<br><br>At the memorial a week later in her yard, Ann looked like an elegant, vulnerable young eagle. She has always been beautiful, white- haired for the thirty-five years I have known her, tiny but a huge presence in the larger theatrical world, still with a trace of a New Zealand accent. I got there early enough to help her older son set up the yard. Sandy is a few years younger than I am, and the handsomest man I have ever known, and he has buried two husbands. We sat with his mother while she put on her face, as she put it, but she still looked like a charcoal drawing that had been worked over, part of it erased, part of it in high relief.<br><br>We got things ready for the thirty or forty people we expected&#x2014;chairs, silverware, wine. The three of us were to be the speakers. Salvation in these dire situations is to worry about the material world, futzing and putzing, folding napkins, unfolding chairs. <br><br>Sandy looked even more like Ann that after- noon, charcoal smudges under his eyes, and fine chiseled cheekbones, fierce intensity underneath his thrumming fear. People arrived and took a turn with the sacrament of ploppage, in a chair beside gentle, regal Ann.<br><br>Things began with all the guests shuffling in Ann&#x2019;s long, skinny concrete yard. It was a sort of do-si-do with chairs and people, including Sandy&#x2019;s and Jay&#x2019;s stepmother, and exes, and exes of exes.<br><br>We placed the chairs in the shade of the trees under which Jay had found some peace here, fig, magnolia, plum. When Ann had asked him a few months earlier why he had left his home in the East and come back to live with her, he said that he wanted to help her, as she had grown so old, and that he knew he would find some peace and welcome in her backyard.<br><br>We made a wobbly long oval of irregular chairs, plastic patio chairs, and fancy dining room chairs, so perfectly imperfect on this tough day. It was not a tidy event: not one thing matched another, not people, not the sky, bright blue with clouds, a breeze, crows.<br> I was the officiant, I guess. I said, This is hard, and we all loved him so, and will miss him. We feel him here now, in wholeness once more, hovering, yet we will never get to talk to him on the phone again or at dinner, and this is too awful to bear. I said, Let&#x2019;s keep the beauty and sorrow in front of us now, in memories, silences, poetry.<br><br>I shared some reminiscences of Jay as a happy boy, a handsome blond teenager beside his suave, dark brother, with their great huge goof ball of a dog. I remembered a few Christ- mases back, when he skipped the family dinner to instead make dozens of sandwiches to pass out to the homeless in our area. I gave a tip of the hat for the bravery of his friends who stayed close and involved even as he grew so defeated.<br><br>Sandy went next. He had notes, but didn&#x2019;t read from them. You felt both constriction and generosity in his sharing, of his brother&#x2019;s lethal empathy, of vacations, other gardens, holidays, camping, college, his children, and his crushing troubles.<br><br>Then Ann, at peace and in grief, stood up trembling and shared the note he had left for her. Like most suicide notes, it said, I have to do this. I&#x2019;m sorry. Please forgive and release me. Don&#x2019;t be sad. And I love you; love you. Then she called forth Jay, in baby baths, at the beach, on a trike, at the prom, and here, smoking and resting among the f lowers. She gave thanks for the gestational period of ten months they&#x2019;d spent together at what turned out to be the end, for the communion and care he received and gave to Ann, for that time they had needed so badly, an intimacy most of us cannot imagine.<br><br>In the garden, where he had walked, paced, rested, we were holding him and releasing him, inside the ring of trees, ferns, rosebushes, a cherry plum. That is the purpose of memorial services, to cry and hold on and stick together, as well as to release ourselves from the grinding regret: How could this have happened? How can such pain exist? What else should we have done? How could doctors not help him, with all those meds and treatments, not help him get free of that bad brain any other way? He was at the mercy of it, of bad brain, yet he held out so long, for Ann, to help her. So mercy has claws, too, that don&#x2019;t easily let go.<br><br>God doesn&#x2019;t give us answers. God gives us grace and mercy. God gives us Her own self. Left to my own devices, I would prefer answers. This is why it is good that I am in charge of so little: the pets, the shopping, the garden. Ann plants flowerbeds of white impatiens every year, because they reflect moonlight in...</p><h2>The Original Gospels: an English Translation from the Old Syriac manuscripts, the Latin Codex Vercellensis and the most Ancient Greek Papyri</h2><p>The ORIGINAL GOSPELS presents a very literal English translation of each of the four Gospels from the most ancient manuscripts. Although this translation is literal, it uses a modern English vocabulary, grammar and syntax.There is an introductory chapter on the life and times of Jesus in first century Palestine. It draws upon selections from such ancient writers and historians as Josephus, Philo of Alexandria, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dio, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the ancient Talmud. This historical background sets the stage for what unfolds in the gospels. All of the ancient theologians agreed that Matthew originally wrote in the native tongue of Palestine - Aramaic (also known as Syriac). This book translates the oldest Aramaic manuscripts directly into English. It includes numerous footnotes with alternate definitions of key Aramaic words, to help the reader fully appreciate what Jesus said and did - these Aramaic words have been transliterated into English characters to give the reader an idea of how they were pronounced.Many ancient and medieval sources claimed that MARK was written in Latin at Rome, rather than Greek. The very best Old Latin manuscript, the Codex Vercellensis, which has NEVER been previously translated into English, is now available for the first time! Lost portions of the Vercelli book have been replaced with readings from closely related Old Latin manuscripts, including the nearly identical Codex Sangallensis (n). The reader will discover that the Old Latin version lacks the &#34;difficult&#34; readings that plagued the Greek text, such as Mark 3:21, which said that the followers of Jesus thought He was out of his mind.LUKE and JOHN were indeed written in Greek, but only in the last 50 years have second century manuscripts been found. Unlike other manuscripts, these copies are nearly complete. Luke has been translated from Papyri 4 and 75, and John from Papyrus 66. The lacunae from these manuscripts have been filled in from the Codex Vaticanus, a 4th century text.Disputed and latter-day corrupted readings have been appended in separate sections at the end of each Gospel along with notations as to which of the other ancient manuscripts support them.Like the text of Matthew, the reader does not need to know Latin or Greek to appreciate the translation of Mark, Luke and John. This book was designed for pastors, teachers and students who desire to have a deeper understanding of what Jesus said and did according to the four evangelists.This brown cover edition replaces the previous blue and red cover editions. The English translation and grammar has been refined to improve the clarity and intent of the original text.</p><p>The author has taught theology classes at Richland College in Dallas on The History of the Gospels, The Life and Times of Jesus, The New and Old Testament Apocrypha, Contrasting Islam to Christianity, and &#34;Is God Dead?&#34; Based on exhaustive research and analysis over the past twenty years, he believes that the Gospels, as they were originally written by the four evangelists, are the inspired words of God without error or defect. AGAINST MODERN HERESIES is a companion work to this book, which presents a detailed history of how and when the four gospels were written - complete with an in-depth analysis of the major variants in the text. It presents detailed evidence to show that Matthew was originally written in Aramaic and Mark in Latin. The author holds a Masters Degree in Theological Studies from Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, Summa cum Laude, with an emphasis on New Testament Studies. He can read and translate Aramaic, Latin and Greek into English.</p><h2>Wise Words and Quotes</h2><p>Many great things have been said since the beginning of time. Many are wise, many are funny, and some are both. <i>Wise Words and Quotes</i> presents classic sayings that encourage, inspire, and entertain.</p><p></p><h2>Lincoln&#39;s Sword: The Presidency and the Power of Words</h2><p>Widely considered in his own time as a genial but provincial lightweight who was out of place in the presidency, Abraham Lincoln astonished his allies and confounded his adversaries by producing a series of speeches and public letters so provocative that they helped revolutionize public opinion on such critical issues as civil liberties, the use of black soldiers, and the emancipation of slaves. This is a brilliant and unprecedented examination of how Lincoln used the power of words to not only build his political career but to keep the country united during the Civil War.</p><p><b>Douglas L.

Before leaving his hometown, he had said a series of good-byes. Ten days earlier he had paid an emotional visit to his aged stepmother and visited the grave of his father. He had hosted a public reception, personally greeting the hundreds of well-wishers who streamed into and out of his house at Eighth and Jackson. The day before, he had made a final, nostalgic visit to his law office and his law partner of sixteen years, William H. Herndon. Inside the Great Western Railway station, just prior to his train&#x2019;s departure, he gravely shook hands with the loyal contingent of close friends who had braved an early morning hour and drizzling rain to see him off. Ordinarily a man of remarkable self-control, Lincoln was unable to disguise his feelings. As he shook hands with his friends, according to a reporter on the scene, &#x201c;his face was pale and quivered with emotion so deep as to render him almost unable to utter a single word.&#x201d; Lincoln&#x2019;s rare display of emotion must have been evident to the larger crowd of well-wishers waiting outside the station. They had gathered in the street, between the station and the &#x201c;stub,&#x201d; or sidetrack, into which the special train was backed for boarding, and Lincoln and his party had to pass through them to reach the train. &#x201c;As Mr. Lincoln mounted the platform of the car,&#x201d; observed another reporter, many in the crowd seemed &#x201c;deeply affected, and he himself scarcely able to check the emotions of the hour.&#x201d; The night before, he had told the reporters traveling with him that he would make no remarks at the station, but once inside the car, he changed his mind. He returned to the platform at the rear of the car and removed his hat. The crowd grew silent, and the men in the crowd responded by removing theirs. An old friend who was present, James C. Conkling, wrote the next day to his son: &#x201c;It was quite affecting. Many eyes were filled to overflowing as Mr. Lincoln uttered those few and simple words which you will see in the papers. His own breast heaved with emotion and he could scarcely command his feelings sufficiently to commence.&#x201d; Different versions of Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;few and simple words&#x201d; were reported in newspapers, but in 1887, his former secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay, published an authoritative text of the speech, which they transcribed from a manuscript in Lincoln&#x2019;s own hand (see Fig. 1-1): My friends&#x2014;No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe every thing. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being, who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and remain with you and be every where for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.This handwritten text confirmed the judgment of the original Springfield audience that his farewell had been a very poignant and affecting speech. As many commentators have pointed out, these nine sentences admirably display Lincoln&#x2019;s talent for conciseness, for weaving together appropriate words and rhythms, and for saying ordinary things in an extraordinary and memorable way. This text is duly reported in all modern biographies and has been inscribed in stone at the Illinois State Capitol. But these words are not the ones he uttered at the railway station in 1861. What Lincoln actually said on that occasion is difficult to determine with any degree of precision, for the contemporary accounts vary. What is clear from abundant testimony, and from the evidence of the manuscript itself, is that he wrote out this text not before the speech, but afterward, on the train. That his manuscript text is not an exact replication of the words he had spoken on the platform can be shown by a close comparison of the various accounts, but it is also evident from the many eyewitness reports of the dramatic climax of the occasion. The <i>New York Herald</i> reporter Henry Villard, who had been in Springfield covering the president-elect closely for six weeks, wrote in his report: &#x201c;Towards the conclusion of his remarks himself and audience were moved to tears. His exhortation to pray elicited choked exclamations of &#x2018;We will do it; we will do it.&#x2019; &#x201d; The dispatch that was most widely printed and whose text is probably the closest to what Lincoln said also noted the visible emotion in the audience and recorded a similar response: &#x201c;Loud applause and cries of &#x2018;We will pray for you.&#x2019; &#x201d; This spontaneous emotional exchange between Lincoln and the crowd seems to have escaped the notice of most of his biographers, but it is, in fact, clearly evident in all the on-the-scene accounts. According to Lincoln&#x2019;s hometown paper, this touching moment was marked by his appealing to the crowd &#x201c;with the earnestness of a sudden inspiration of feeling.&#x201d; The report that would seem to be the nearest approximation of Lincoln&#x2019;s spoken words renders the passage this way: He [Washington] never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support, and I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance . . . It was doubtless at this point that the crowd, responding to his emotional plea, began to erupt with cries of &#x201c;We will pray for you&#x201d; or &#x201c;We will do it,&#x201d; even before the conclusion of the sentence: . . . without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain. In his manuscript text, this earnest appeal for the prayers of his audience is present but deliberately muted and unobtrusively folded into the final sentence: &#x201c;To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.&#x201d; This raises an obvious question: why did Lincoln, in writing out a revised version of his speech, play down its most electrifying moment so that it virtually disappeared from view? One possibility is that he had second thoughts about how it would look to have his first public utterance as president-elect be a plea for prayers. Indeed, J. G. Holland recalled in his 1866 biography that there had been just such public comment at the time. But why Lincoln effectively suppressed what had been the most affecting part of his speech when he came to write it out is surely best understood not in terms of message but of medium. Lincoln knew from long experience that addressing a live audience is very different from addressing readers on the page. A speaker before an audience has special tools at his command&#x2014;body language, gestures, facial expressions, volume and tone of voice, pace, and so on. Because he has direct contact with his audience, a speaker can gauge its mood and receptiveness and can take immediate advantage of its reactions. The writer must rely on other devices, and a seasoned practitioner of both forms of expression like Lincoln could be expected to adapt his text accordingly. In speaking to the crowd at the train station, for example, he could sense the emotion of the audience rising to meet his own and spontaneously put in an appeal for their prayers. But in an address for the consumption of silent and invisible readers, who were not in the grips of an emotional leave-taking, the situation would be very different. The appeal therefore had to take a different form. What is of interest here is that Lincoln&#x2019;s manuscript text is not a reiteration of his speech, but a revision. Asked by Villard to write out his remarks after the speech, Lincoln knew instinctively that what he had said extemporaneously would have to be reshaped and reconstituted to work as well for readers as it had for those present at the send-off. And because he was a seasoned practitioner in the art of revision, this was a clear opportunity to improve upon what he had said. Looking at some of the differences between the spoken and the written versions affords an opportunity to see the results of this process. Take, for example, the sentence from the spoken version &#x201c;To this people I owe all that I am.&#x201d; In its revised form, this became &#x201c;To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.&#x201d; One of the most discerning admirers of Lincoln&#x2019;s writing, the historian Jacques Barzun, has called attention to this sentence in making the case that the key to &#x201c;Lincoln&#x2019;s extraordinary power&#x201d; as a writer was his ability &#x201c;to make his spirit felt.&#x201d; Lincoln&#x2019;s writing, Barzun argues, tends to reflect a complicated sense of himself in relation to his audience. In his typical self-deprecating way, he often managed to create an &#x201c;emotional distance&#x201d; between himself and his audience that he used to advantage in his speeches and writings. Nowhere is this clearer, according to Barzun, than in the second sentence of the Farewell Address. &#x201c;If we stop to think, we ask: &#x2018;This place&#x2019;?&#x2014;yes. But why &#x2018;<i>these</i> people&#x2019;? Why not &#x2018;you people,&#x2019; whom he was addressing from the train platform, or &#x2018;this place and the kindness of <i>its</i> people&#x2019;? . . . &#x2018;These&#x2019; is a stroke of genius,&#x201d; Barzun says, because it has &#x201c;Lincoln talking to himself about the place and the people whom he was leaving, foreboding the possibility of his never returning.&#x201d; The linchpin of Barzun&#x2019;s observation&#x2014;the word &#x201c;these&#x201d;&#x2014;was not, of course, in the reports of the spoken address but appears only in Lincoln&#x2019;s written revision. Another good example is the passage considered earlier, which the likeliest report of the speech as actually spoken renders like this: I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support, and I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain. With the plea for prayer removed, this becomes in revision Without the assistance of that Divine Being, who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Here Lincoln has seized the necessity for recasting his plea for the prayers of his audience to refine and bring out the latent rhetorical antithesis in the passage. In fact, as we shall see, a special talent for antithesis, the balanced opposition of words or phrases, would stamp nearly all of Lincoln&#x2019;s greatest writings as president. Another example of how Lincoln improved his text in revising his speech for general readers, as opposed to local listeners, is a subtle change to the treatment of his life in Springfield. The report that seems closest to what he actually said on the platform has one notable omission, an element that appears in all other accounts. This is the reference to growing from a young to an old man. For purposes of comparing the spoken with the written versions, this element has been inserted in brackets. Here I have lived more than a quarter of a century [and have passed from a young to an old man]; here my children were born, and here one of them lies buried. This is an effective passage whose appeal depends on a parallelism of clauses and the cadenced repetition of the word &#x201c;here.&#x201d; But in the revision, the modification, though not great, results in a significantly different feel. Here I have been a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. There are a number of changes in this passage that are worthy of comment, but here it will suffice to point out but one, the change from &#x201c;Here I have <i>lived</i>&#x201d; to &#x201c;Here I have <i>been</i>." Because Lincoln&#x2019;s train-shaken handwriting was so difficult to decipher (see Fig. 1-2), his secretaries failed to note this change, which does not seem to have been detected until recently. Nonetheless, it is confirmed by the text printed the next day in the <i>New York Herald</i>, which Villard says came from a copy Lincoln gave him. The speaker on the platform who spoke the word &#x201c;lived&#x201d; almost certainly did not know that he would shortly use the words &#x201c;born&#x201d; and &#x201c;buried,&#x201d; much less that, taken together, they would poignantly sum up a full range of life experiences. But the writer on the train did know it. The word he substituted, &#x201c;been,&#x201d; clearly anticipates the words &#x201c;born&#x201d; and &#x201c;buried&#x201d; and forms an alliterative bond with them, but it also gives a different sense of the speaker. It conveys a certain rootedness and has a subtle resonance of its own. The comparison with George Washington, the most revered figure in American history, as a way of calling attention to the difficulty he faced, was bold to the point of presumption. In the largest chamber of the Illinois State Capitol, which was regularly used for public events and where Lincoln had frequently appeared, the speaker stood directly under a large, looming portrait of the first president, an image that was probably summoned to mind by his Springfield listeners at the railway station. In calling attention to his mission of somehow preserving what Washington had established, Lincoln managed to conjure up, without having to name them, a cluster of deep-rooted patriotic meanings, such as loyalty, service, dedication, and sacrifice. As originally uttered, the comparison with Washington was effectively introduced: I know not how soon I shall see you again. A duty devolves upon me which is, perhaps, greater than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of Washington. Spoken by a fellow townsman taking his leave, the first sentence must have been quite affecting, but given the slightly stilted and self-conscious character of its expression, its appeal on the page to strangers would likely be much less. Better to begin on a stronger note and meld the messages of the two sentences (thirty-three words) into one (twenty-four). I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Less, with Lincoln, was often more, as in this case, but as serious writers know only too well, this is much easier said than done. The revised lead-in to the comparison of himself with Washington is a good demonstration that Lincoln knew how it was done.</p><h2>Holy Moly Carry Me (American Poets Continuum, 166)</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2018 National Jewish Book Award for Poetry</b></p><br><p><b>Finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry</b></p><br><br><p>Erika Meitner&#x2019;s fifth collection of poetry plumbs human resilience and grit in the face of disaster, loss, and uncertainty.

After teaching for several years in Des Moines, she decided to homestead in the Oklahoma panhandle; she and her husband, Will, remained Oklahoma farmers until their deaths in 1966. In addition to her farm duties--and raising a daughter who became a physician--Caroline Henderson moonlighted as a writer for farm and ladies' publications in the years before World War I and for national publications such as <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> during the Depression. Her descriptions of the Dust Bowl years brought her national recognition.

Personal and touching, a stirring counterpart to her novel <em>IrmaVoth</em> and reminiscent of works by Susan Cheever, Gail Caldwell, Mary Karr, and Alexandra Styron, <em>Swing Low </em>is an elegiac ode to a difficult life by an author drawing from the deepest well of insight,craft, and emotion.<br></p></p><p>After her father took his own life in 1998, Miriam Toews decided to face her confusion and pain straight on. In writing her father's memoir, she was motivated by two primary goals: For her own sake, she needed to understand, or at least accept, her father's final decision. For her father's sake, she needed to honour him, to elucidate his life and to demonstrate its worth. <br>Apart from its brief prologue and epilogue, Swing Low" is written entirely from Mel Toews's perspective. Miriam Toews has her father tell his story from bed as he waits in a Steinbach hospital to be transferred to a psychiatric facility in Winnipeg. Mel turns to writing to make sense of his condition, to review his life in the hope of seeing it more clearly. He remembers himself as an anxious child, the son of a despondent father and an alcoholic mother, who never once made him feel loved. At seventeen he was diagnosed with manic depression (now known as bipolar disorder). His psychiatrist's predictions were grim: Mel shouldn't count on marrying, starting a family or holding down a job. With great courage and determination, Mel went on to do all three: he married his childhood sweetheart, had two happy daughters and was a highly respected and beloved teacher for forty years. <br>Although Mel was able to keep his disorder hidden from the community, his family frequently witnessed his unravelling. Over the years this schism between his public and private life grew wider. An outgoing and tireless trailblazer at school, he often collapsed into silence and despair at home. Ironically, in trying to win his family's love through hard work and accomplishments, he deprived them of what they yearned for most: his presence, his voice. Once he retired from teaching - "the daily ritual of stepping outside himself" - Mel lost his creative outlet and, with it, his hope. <br>In the "Globe and Mail, author Moira Farr described "Swing Low as "audacious, original and profoundly moving." She added: "Getting into the head of your own father - your own largely silent, mentally ill father, who killed himself - has to be a kind of literary high-wire act that few would dare to try.... Healing is a likely outcome of a book imbued with the righteous anger, compassion and humanity of Swing Low."<p>One morning, Mel Toews put on his coat and hat, walked out of town, and took his own life. A loving husband and father, a faithful member of the Mennonite church, and an immensely popular schoolteacher, Mel was a pillar of his close-knit community. Yet after a lifetime of struggling with bipolar disorder, he could no longer face the darkness that clouded his world. In this moving meditation on illness, family, faith, and love, Mel&#x2019;s daughter, critically acclaimed novelist and reporter Miriam Toews, recounts her father&#x2019;s life as he would have told it, in his own voice, right up to the day of his final walk. </p><p><em>Swing Low</em> is a bold, gracefully written, and compassionate recounting of one man&#x2019;s heartbreaking battle with depression.</p></p><h2>The Flower Drum Song</h2><p>Originally published in 1957, <i>The Flower Drum Song</i> was a groundbreaking work of popular literature.

Lee</p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>Author&#x2019;s Note</p><p>In the late forties, Chinatown in Los Angeles was a roofed bazaar the size of two football fields. I&#x2019;d moved there after escaping China during the Second World War on a student visa and subsequently finding that the Master&#x2019;s in Fine Arts I had from Yale wasn&#x2019;t helpful in making me a successful playwright or getting a job at the U.N. as an interpreter.</p><p>One morning, as I was having my daily 25-cent bowl of noodles, I read an announcement in the <i>Chinese World</i> that would turn my life around. The paper was preparing to publish an English section and needed a columnist. I went home and wrote two sample manuscripts, naming my proposed column &#x201c;So I Say.&#x201d; A week later, I received a check for ten dollars and a letter from the editor asking me to submit five columns a week, for which he would pay me $5 each. I calculated on my fingers: $25 a week would buy a lot of noodles. I threw my arms into the air and cheered. For the first time in my life I could make money from writing.</p><p>I wrote about life, love, and emotions to appeal to the younger generation who could read English, and my column became quite popular. I was promoted to assistant editor and, in addition to my regular column, began translating some news stories from the American papers. The paper was based in San Francisco, and I could move there if I was interested. I moved immediately.</p><p>Mr. Li Ta-Ming&#x2019;s <i>Chinese World</i> occupied a large upstairs room on Grand Avenue in San Francisco. It was crowded, busy, and noisy. My duties now included searching for some city scandals from the English papers&#x2014;and inventing a few if necessary. I rented a little room above a Filipino nightclub on Kearney Street, a short walk from the office. The room was cheap because of the noise from the club. I settled into San Francisco life and began my first novel.</p><p>One afternoon, just as I finished that day&#x2019;s column, I received a call from a man with a gravelly voice. He started asking me all kinds of questions, and I immediately thought he was from the Immigration Service. &#x201c;Officer,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all packed. Deport me any time.&#x201d; The caller didn&#x2019;t know what I was talking about. It turned out he was the editor of <i>Writer&#x2019;s Digest</i> informing me that I had won first prize in their short story contest. He wanted to make sure I was the right Lee before he sent me the prize money of $750. When the editor&#x2019;s formal letter and check arrived, I brought them to the Immigration Service to apply for an extension of stay. The pokerfaced officer studied my case, shoved some papers at me and told me to fill them in and sign. They were papers for permanent residence. If approved, I could become an American citizen in five years.</p><p>I finished my novel and found an agent, Ann Elmo, to represent it. Ann called one summer day to give me an update: my novel, <i>The Flower Drum Song</i>, had been turned down by almost every major publisher in New York. She hinted that after one more rejection, she would return it and I should think of another line of occupation. A week later she called again and said, &#x201c;Keep writing, Lee. A highbrow publisher, Farrar, Straus and Cudahy, has bought your book.&#x201d; She added that the publisher liked it because it was quaint and episodic&#x2014;the very reasons the other publishers had turned it down.</p><p>A month later I took a trip to New York and had a chance to meet John Farrar, my editor and a senior partner at the publishing house. He told me that my manuscript of <i>The Flower Drum Song</i> had first landed on the sick bed of an eighty-year-old reader who worked for the publisher screening submissions. The elderly gentleman, having finished the book, didn&#x2019;t have enough energy to write a detailed critique. With his last bit of strength, he scribbled on the dog-eared cover, &#x201c;Read This,&#x201d; and died. I especially enjoyed retelling this story when <i>The Flower Drum Song</i> climbed onto <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list. Radio Free Asia soon offered me a job. I took it and resigned from the newspaper, but I still kept that cheap room on Kearney Street.</p><p>One late afternoon Ann Elmo called me from New York with some good news. There were quite a few nibbles for <i>The Flower Drum Song</i>, and two of them were very promising. A Broadway producer had offered $3,000 to option the book for two years to make a stage play, and an independent Hollywood producer had offered $50,000 to buy all the dramatic rights outright, including film. Ann wanted me to choose one of these two offers. I promised my agent that I would give her my answer the next morning.</p><p>That night I didn&#x2019;t write. I returned to my room to think things over. If I took the $3,000 I could collect future royalties from the play. If the play failed, though, I wouldn&#x2019;t get anything but the $3,000. If I accepted the Hollywood producer&#x2019;s money, I would be quite rich for a while. I could move to Nob Hill, take a trip to Europe, and come home with plenty of money left in the bank. For a while.</p><p>I lay on my squeaky bed and stared at the ceiling. For the first time I didn&#x2019;t mind the roof-shaking music; it gave my room a festive mood. I could have jumped at the guaranteed big money, and yet, something seemed to hold me back. My frugal nature and my desire for instant security were pushing me one way, but something else, maybe a gambling gene telling me to throw the dice, was pulling me the other way. Finally, I decided to get a drink. I went downstairs and bought a Budweiser, the best in the Filipino nightclub. Sipping my beer from the bottle, I began to relax, then I began to feel good. I even forgot I had a problem to solve.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what happened to me that night. I might have gotten drunk and dozed off or made some drunken disturbance that was safely covered by the worse noises from downstairs. The next morning I woke up with a hangover, a little ashamed that only one beer could have conked me out. When I remembered my dilemma, the phone rang. It was Ann Elmo, calling to congratulate me on having made the right decision.</p><p><i>C.Y. Lee</i></p><p>Introduction</p><p>As a child growing up in Los Angeles during the 1960s, I developed a somewhat curious practice: if I heard that a particular movie or television show featured Asian characters, I would go out of my way <i>not</i> to watch it. I would not have been able to articulate a reason for my behavior, other than the fact that the images made me feel &#x201c;icky.&#x201d; This was a time when Asian characters in American popular culture could be generally characterized as &#x201c;inhuman,&#x201d; either inhumanly bad (e.g. Fu Manchu; evil Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese soldiers, take your pick) or inhumanly good (e.g. Charlie Chan; the plethora of Asian women who died for the love of a white B-movie actor). Some of these odd creatures who looked like me served as the butt of derisive humor, due to their grotesque mannerisms, bizarre customs, and an endlessly amusing inability to distinguish between the letters <i>r</i> and <i>l.</i> Yet one work stood as an exception: I can&#x2019;t recall the first time I encountered <i>Flower Drum Song</i>&#x2014;not the novel or the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein stage musical, but the 1961 film version of that Broadway show. It was no doubt on some late-night television movie, and I was pleasantly shocked: here were Asians who spoke without an accent, in a love story between Asian men and Asian women, singing and dancing up a storm to beautiful, relatively hip music. For Asian American baby-boomers like me, this portrayal was, for its time, nothing short of revolutionary.</p><p>By the time I attended college in the late 1970s, campuses were buzzing with artists and activists representing Americans whose voices had been ignored or marginalized by mainstream society. We sought our own revolution, to shake up a literary establishment that considered, for example, the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald to be true literature, while those of Toni Morrison were merely ethnic works of limited appeal. We agitated for the right of Asian American writers to define our own identities and communities, rather than permitting these images to be drawn by the dominant (i.e. Caucasian) society, which had done such a poor job of portraying us in my youth. As part of this movement, we condemned (rather simplistically) virtually all portrayals of Asian Americans that had been created by non-Asians. So I ended up protesting <i>Flower Drum Song</i>, which had become associated almost exclusively with the movie and musical, as &#x201c;inauthentic.&#x201d; But even at such political gatherings, if I took a protester aside privately, he might well reply, &#x201c;Actually, I sort of like it.&#x201d; The movie remained a guilty pleasure for many of us, even at our most politically extreme.</p><p>By the early-1980s, the few who did recall that Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein had drawn upon source material by an immigrant Chinese American chose to ignore it. As I began discovering my own voice as a writer, Asian American Studies classes were springing up around the country. We were searching for our own literary history, works neither white American nor foreign Asian, but specifically Asian American. Writers and scholars rediscovered John Okada&#x2019;s <i>No No Boy</i> (1957) and Louis Chu&#x2019;s <i>Eat a Bowl of Tea</i> (1961). C.Y. Lee&#x2019;s <i>The Flower Drum Song</i> (1957), however, was neither reclaimed nor celebrated. A new generation of scholars began to compile what would eventually become an Asian American literary canon, but omitted this prominent Chinese American novel.</p><p>The omission was deliberate, I believe, resulting from two realities of that period. Foremost was the novel&#x2019;s association with the musical and movie. To the extent that we discredited the musical <i>Flower Drum Song</i> as inauthentic, the novel became tainted by association; the unsophisticated politics of that period could not accommodate such a distinction. Second was a reverse-snobbery whereby the very success of the novel in the general marketplace rendered it suspect as an example of true Asian American literature. This sort of prejudice is not limited to ethnic studies scholars. It often happens in mainstream circles that a critically acclaimed artist is abandoned by his allies after achieving popular success: if the masses like it, how artistic could it be? Similarly, Asian American critics might have argued that if white readers had liked <i>The Flower Drum Song</i>, how &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; could it be?</p><p>By the mid-1990s, when I began to consider writing a remake of the musical <i>Flower Drum Song</i>, the novel had more or less vanished from both mainstream and Asian American consciousness. A few scholars, such as the late Amy Ling of the University of Wisconsin, were brave enough to buck the tide of fashion by writing about author Chin Yang Lee, but by and large his first novel and his subsequent ten works were ignored by both English Literature and Asian American Studies departments. (An exception was Boston University, where a C.Y. Lee Archive was established at Mugar Memorial Library.) Lee&#x2019;s body of work as well as his literary reputation have long been secure in Taiwan, but when I looked for the novel that had inspired Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein here in America, I found it virtually impossible to obtain a copy. Luckily, through a mutual friend, I obtained a used copy from the invaluable Seattle bookseller David Ishii. I pulled the well-preserved hardcover from its mailing paper and sat down to investigate this forgotten novel with the world-famous title.</p><p>With the turn of each page, I grew increasingly moved and excited. I had not experienced a feeling like this since I first picked up Maxine Hong Kingston&#x2019;s <i>The Woman Warrior</i> (1976) as a college student. Here were characters, cultures, and situations that I knew well but had never expected to encounter so intimately on a published page. Yet there were differences between my Lee and Kingston experiences. In the 1970s, I was a young aspiring writer at a time when any Asian American work was still a rarity. By the late 1990s, I had become a middle-aged playwright, and in the intervening years had witnessed a blossoming of Asian American writing, much of it to critical and popular acclaim. My experience with <i>The Flower Drum Song</i>, therefore, was like discovering a long-lost ancestor, a forgotten branch of my family tree, a missing piece of literary history for which I felt particular affinity.</p><p>I sought out the author, who was by then in his seventies and living in southern California. Spry, affable, and sporting a mischievous smile, C.Y. Lee met me for lunch in the Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park, home to a large and growing Chinese community. Over dishes of the type featured in the novel, he described the humorous and providential manner by which this novel came to be, stories he&#x2019;d no doubt recounted most of his life, but which still seemed fresh. Lee had come from China as a foreign student and graduated from Yale Drama School. Upon the advice of an agent, who told him plays about China would never sell, Lee switched to prose, and lived in a small room above a Filipino restaurant in San Francisco&#x2019;s Chinatown, eking out a living editing a Cantonese newspaper and waiting for immigration ...</p></p><h2>She Begat This: 20 Years of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</h2><p><b>An NPR 2018 Great Read</b><br> <br><b>Celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the acclaimed and influential debut album <i>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill </i>with this eye-opening and moving exploration of Lauryn Hill and her remarkable artistic legacy.</b><br><br>Released in 1998, Lauryn Hill&#x2019;s first solo album is often cited by music critics as one of the most important recordings in modern history. Artists from Beyonc� to Nicki Minaj to Janelle Mon�e have claimed it as an inspiration, and it was recently included in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, as well as named the second greatest album by a woman in history by NPR (right behind Joni Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Blue</i>).<br> <br> Award-winning feminist author and journalist Joan Morgan delivers an expansive, in-depth, and heartfelt analysis of the album and its enduring place in pop culture. <i>She Begat This </i>is both an indelible portrait of a magical moment when a young, fierce, and determined singer-rapper-songwriter made music history and a crucial work of scholarship, perfect for longtime hip-hop fans and a new generation of fans just discovering this album.</p><p>A pioneering hip-hop journalist and award-winning feminist author, Joan Morgan coined the term &#x201c;hip-hop feminism&#x201d; in 1999 with the publication of&nbsp;<i>When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost</i>, which is now used at colleges across the country. Morgan has taught at Duke University, Stanford University, and The New School.&#x201c;Joan Morgan schools like no other. While reading this masterful, rich, and amazingly concise cultural history of the Nina-Simone-Defecating-On-Your-Microphone-Nineties, I learned two lessons. One, you cannot tell the story of Hip Hop or Black womanhood in the 1990s without a deep understanding of the prototype for Black Girl Genius that is Lauryn Hill. And two, you cannot tell the story of Hip Hop or Black womanhood in the 1990s without the fiya-spitting, Jamaican, Bronx-girl pen of Joan Morgan. Lauryn gave us the soundtrack, the artistry, and the permission. Joan and her crew of badass, pioneering Hip Hop journalists, many of whom are featured here, continue to give us the language and the frameworks to understand the singularity of turn-of-the-21st-century Black cultural production. Absent either of these Black girl geniuses, the story is incomplete.

Growing up in Nazi&#x2010;occupied Strasbourg, drawing caricatures was for him a form of resistance. Described on his school&#x2013;leaving certificate as a "depraved and rebellious character", he hitch&#x2010;hiked around Europe, getting as far as Lapland, rather than going to university. Inspired by his heroes Saul Steinberg, James Thurber and Charles Addams, Ungerer landed in New York in 1956, with only $60 dollars in his pocket and a suitcase full of drawings. He quickly found success as an illustrator and caricaturist, becoming a star almost overnight.

The first title, which was dedicated to Maurice Sendak, features a retired tax collector with a prized pear tree. When the man awakens one day to find his precious fruit has been stolen, he is determined to capture the culprit. He succeeds in catching the thief, but instead of vengeance, he is consumed with curiosity about and affection for gentle, lumpy beast. "I lost my pears but found a companion" says the old tax collector. When he takes his rare, unusual specimen to Paris to present to the Academy and a hoax is revealed, a media circus of monumental proportions ensues. This quirky story defies expectations and charms with its wit and subtle wisdom. The art is uproarious and as appealing as ever.

In modern times probably no genius of the Western world still ignites such passionate controversy as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Only Marx, Nietzsche and Freud -- in many ways, his successors -- come even close.<p>Why is this? Because Rousseau blew up the edifice of 2,500 years of classical and Christian thought about the fundamental nature of the soul and society. Until Rousseau, nearly everyone agreed that humanity was by nature sinful and vicious, and that the state, religion and other social structures imposed a needed order on our conduct. Without higher authority to moderate passions, men and women would spend their short, nasty and brutish lives like jungle beasts. From religion and education, we learn self-control and the ways of righteousness; from the laws and customs of society, we are shaped into good and useful citizens.</p><p>Not so, said this political visionary: "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Our natural impulses are healthy and good; it is society that makes us wicked. Where once we lived in harmony with ourselves and with the world around us, now we dwell in a snake pit of appearance and inauthenticity, of competitiveness and conspicuous consumption, of inequality, prejudice and pervasive baseness. Our institutions and governments disfigure and corrupt everything they touch. We long for happiness, without recognizing that it is the system we live under that taints our souls and leaves us alienated, despairing and hungry for something we cannot even name.</p><p>How did we go so wrong? In the myth or thought experiment that Rousseau offers in his discourse On the Origin of Inequality (1755), he concludes that the serpent in the garden was nothing less than Reason. When people lived unmediated existences in accord with Nature and themselves, when they dwelt like Peter Pan in a perpetual present, they found life simple, fulfilling and harmonious. But on some evil day, one man began to compare himself with another. This led to reflection, self-awareness and eventually competitiveness, then to specialization and a division of labor to maximize individual strengths and weaknesses, and before long the floodgates were opened to envy, accumulation and excess. The clever soon exploited their fellows, stockpiled provisions and gained superfluous wealth -- and these inevitably needed to be protected by guards, by armies, by laws and statutes. And so paradise was lost.</p><p>And lost forever. Rousseau says there's no real going back. Recorded history is essentially the story of our degradation. But we can and should still strive to ameliorate inequities; we just might establish kindlier small city-states (he thought of Geneva and Corsica) where governmental regulation could be minimized and civic life made human-scaled, but, most of all, we can liberate ourselves.</p><p>Rousseau's contemporary, the arch-conservative Edmund Burke, labeled him "the Socrates of the National Assembly" (that is, of the hated French Revolution). Come the 20th century, this radical thinker had grown into the great beast of all who revere traditional institutions, worship in established churches and either fear or exploit the common man. Yet no one, of whatever political or philosophical persuasion, would deny how deeply Rousseau's sensibility pervades the past 250 years, from the poetry of the Romantics ("One impulse from a vernal wood/ May teach you more of man . . . ") to the slogans, pop songs and lifestyles of the 1960s: Drop out, "Let it be," back to Nature, hippies, communes, self-realization. Yet Rousseauian ideals also lie behind our unabated, unassuaged longings to live more humanely in a bureaucratic, technological and often unjust world. Even the staunchest meritocrat or most self-satisfied scion of inherited wealth must find it hard to discount the truth of the discourse on inequality's final ringing lines: "It is manifestly against the Law of Nature . . . that a handful of men wallow in luxury, while the famished multitudes lack the necessities of life."</p><p>Such thrilling emotional language has always contributed to Rousseau's powerful appeal. Contrary to a widespread misconception, many philosophers have also been superb prose stylists -- just think of Plato, Hume or William James -- but this largely self-educated former valet may be the finest of all. Rousseau actually had to beg his readers to disregard his "beau style" and just pay attention to his ideas. But this is impossible. His sentences are musical and absolutely limpid, at once classically balanced yet intimate, oracular and confessional. One is simply swept along, no matter what the subject.</p><p>So when Rousseau decided to write about two highly moral lovers, the result was Julie, or The New Heloise (1761), the most popular novel of the 18th century. When he published Emile, or On Education (1762), a Utopian pedagogical treatise, mothers turned it into a bible of child-rearing. (For instance, largely because of Rousseau, upper-class women began to breast-feed, rather than wet-nurse, their children.) And when Jean-Jacques finally decided to relate the story of his own checkered past, his Confessions (1782) established the modern autobiography and, to this day, remains the genre's unsurpassed and supreme achievement.</p><p>Yet self-revelation, no matter how sincere the pact to tell the whole truth and nothing but, always possesses a strategy, even an agenda. In his Confessions Rousseau hopes to justify his life against detractors and critics by confessing embarrassing intimacies -- for example, his painful need to constantly urinate -- and owning up to his most shameful memories, in particular the incrimination of an innocent servant girl for a theft he himself committed and the abandonment of his newborn children at foundling hospitals. But this public laceration serves a purpose: Before the judgment of God, can any of his readers maintain that their lives were any better? The Confessions is, at heart, an apologia.</p><p>Which is why Leo Damrosch's deeply informed biography is so welcome. Even if one knows Rousseau's extensive writing about himself -- and this includes that series of exquisite late prose-poems, the Reveries of the Solitary Walker (written in 1776) -- there is still a need for distance and for perspective, for the integration of the works with the life and the life with the times. Damrosch is an academic -- a professor of 18th-century literature at Harvard -- but he nonetheless writes for ordinary readers, with clarity, a light touch and immense zest.</p><p>Just a precis of Rousseau's life shows how remarkable he truly was, especially against the backdrop of ancien regime Europe. Born in Geneva in 1712, Rousseau was brought up by his watchmaker father, his mother having died in childbirth. At the age of 12, he was apprenticed to an engraver, soon ran away and eventually ended up hiking through much of Switzerland, northern Italy and parts of France. Along the way he encountered, like any picaresque hero, beautiful ladies, con artists, kindly priests, disdainful aristocrats. But early on he fell under the spell of a Madame de Warens, whom he called Maman and who subsequently seduced him, rather to his dismay: He says it felt like incest. Only in his thirties did Rousseau finally settle in Paris, at first aiming for a career as a musician. Though he was largely self-taught in composition (as in everything else), his opera "Le Devin du Village" ("The Village Soothsayer," 1752) proved an unexpected success (and is still staged today).</p><p>In Paris he met Therese Levasseur, a nearly illiterate young laundress, who ended up sharing the rest of his life. Choosing to earn his way as a copyist of musical scores, he preferred such a life of simplicity to the "slavery" of patronage. But intellectually that simple life proved abundantly rich, with time to think and time to argue with close friends whose names are now among the most honored in French intellectual history: Diderot, d'Alembert, Condillac. Then one day, on a walk to Vincennes to visit the temporarily imprisoned Diderot, Rousseau happened to see an advertisement in the Mercure de France for an essay contest. He entered it with his Discourse on the Sciences and Arts (1750), won and found himself famous. He was 38, and his real career was finally beginning.</p><p>During the next dozen years, Rousseau produced all his major philosophical work, including his most famous, The Social Contract (1762), which argues what most Americans believe: that the people alone are sovereign, that they possess inalienable rights and that government exists to carry out the general will. But as the years went by, this upstart thinker inevitably quarreled with the shrewdest mind (and finest writer) in Europe -- Voltaire, bien sur -- and gradually grew apart from his old philosophe friends. He fell in love with an aristocratic lady, already married and with an established lover; and, as you would expect, things ended badly. In due course, the authorities decided to ban (and even burn) The Social Contract, so to avoid arrest Rousseau fled into exile, first to Switzerland (where his house was stoned), then to England (traveling there in the company of David Hume). He was hounded, spied upon, hunted. Yet even those with real enemies can grow paranoid, and Rousseau grew crazily suspicious of those around him. Nonetheless, he found occasional oases of tranquility in his later life and died quietly in a house near Paris provided for him by an aristocratic admirer. His last unfinished works, especially the Reveries of the Solitary Walker, show that his prose remained unsurpassed in eloquence to the very end.</p><p>But a passionate eloquence about the human heart and the human condition characterize Rousseau's writing at any point in his life. As a very young man, employed as teacher for a Lyon family, he penned a memorandum outlining his theory of pedagogy. In the middle of these proposals -- which years later found fuller exposition in Emile -- he pauses to ask himself what Damrosch calls "an altogether unexpected question that is prophetic of his entire life's work." Rousseau writes: "Nothing is more depressing than the general fate of men. And yet they feel in themselves a consuming desire to become happy, and it makes them feel at every moment that they were born to be happy. So why are they not?"</p><p>We still argue about the answer to that question. Whether you agree or disagree with Rousseau's view of man's natural goodness and the evils inherent in civilization, his is nonetheless a voice that simply won't go away. Why are we not happy? Why? Why? Damrosch's biography provides an ideal introduction to both this complex man and his troubling ideas. It is an important book, but also a provocative and exceptionally entertaining one. </p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

The events and teaching recorded in John 13-16, commonly known as the Upper Room Discourse, reveal some of the most poignant and powerful promises for believers in all of Scripture.<br> <br> Jesus and His disciples were standing on the precipice of the darkest night in the history of the world. The Lord of glory was about to be betrayed and murdered. The disciples would be scattered, and the boldest of them would deny even knowing Him. <br> <br> The Lord knew full well that He Himself would soon undergo an unimaginable deluge of woe. He would be spit on and mocked by evil men. He would bear the sins of the world. He would be cursed with the wrath of God for others&#x2019; sins. He would feel as if His Father had utterly abandoned Him. Any other man in that situation would have been in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that He would never have been able to focus His attention on the needs of others&#x2015;but Jesus was different. He wanted His followers to know the peace of the One who has overcome the world. <br> <br> During those final hours before Jesus&#x2019; betrayal, He gave His disciples&#x2015;and consequently, all believers throughout history&#x2015;His parting promises, His last will and testament.

Rabbi Zusya was renowned throughout the world for his gifted insights as a scholar, teacher, and healer.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the time came for Rabbi Zusya to leave this world, his students gathered at his bedside. During a tender moment the Rabbi began to weep.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Why do you cry, Rabbi?" asked one of the disciples. "If anyone is assured a place in Heaven, it is you. You are one of the greatest and most revered spiritual teachers in the world!" <br> &nbsp;<br> Rabbi Zusya turned his head softly toward the one who spoke, and looked him in the eye. His gaze was piercing, as one who can see through this world to another.<br> &nbsp;<br> "I will tell you why I weep, my dear one," the sage replied. � &#x38a;f , when I approach the gates of Heaven, the angel who meets me asks, 'Why were you not a Moses?' I shall answer with conviction, 'Because I was not born to be a Moses.'<br> &nbsp;<br> "And if the angel challenges me, But neither did you perform the feats that Elijah did,' I shall firmly respond, 'My mission was not the same one that Elijah was sent to accomplish.'<br> &nbsp;<br> "But there is one question that I fear being unable to answer: 'Why were you not a Rabbi Zusya?' "<br> &nbsp;<br> If I had to sum up my adventure here on earth, I would say that it has been a series of lessons in becoming who I truly am. Mahatma Gandhi entitled his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth. Perhaps my autobiography will one day be called, The Story of My Experiments with Being Myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> At one of my workshops an older gentleman raised his hand and stood up to speak. "I tried being myself once," he quipped. "But it didn't work&#x2014;I realized I didn't have enough experience!"<br> &nbsp;<br> The entire audience laughed with him, perhaps because there was a poignant truth behind his statement, one with which everyone in that room could identify. All of us are seeking to more fully be ourselves. Sometimes our treasured self comes forth in a joyful moment of self-discovery, and sometimes we find ourself through challenge and apparent conflict. No matter what route we take, we all share the awesome journey to the mountaintop of self-awareness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two hundred years after Rabbi Zusya left this world, a little girl came to claim her place in life. At the age of twelve, Jennifer Capriati knocked the tennis world for a loop. Before she had both feet set in adolescence, Jennifer was competing in first class circles, challenging and defeating some of the most formidable adult stars. Not surprisingly, she created quite a sensation among her colleagues and in the media.<br> &nbsp;<br> When asked by an interviewer if she hoped to be the next Chris Evert, Jennifer answered, "No, I want to be the first Jennifer Capriati."<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps it is the same unapologetic confidence in herself that Jennifer manifests on the court. She knows that the only way she can truly succeed is to be what she is, rather than an imitation of someone else.

For more information go to www.ralphhardyfiction.com.</p>Gr 4-7-In this retelling of the ancient tale, the narrator is Argos, Odysseus's dog, left behind on Ithaka. The only way Argos can learn of his master's travels is to "talk" to the birds and other animals that have left the island. Argos speaks to gulls, owls, ravens, plovers, and others to find out the fate of Odysseus. The story follows the classic tale and uses the Greek names for characters and places. Readers learn of Odysseus's visits to Circe and his interactions with the Cyclops and the Sirens, as well as the suitors who hound Penelope, Odysseus's wife. Readers hear, too, of how Argos finds a mate and how his legacy is carried forth by one of his progeny. The prose is written in a style that reflects the ancient Greek origins of the story rather than contemporary speech patterns. Unfortunately, there is no glossary or pronunciation guide, which would be a big help to the target audience.

It comes to a man&#x2019;s career when all of his cautions&#x2014;all that he has held close and private for fear of damaging his reputation and his ambitions for advancement&#x2014;all in a single moment lose their constraint. The moment I speak of, one might surmise, arrives the day&#x2014;or more accurately, the first chime after midnight&#x2014;when one realizes that further advancement is impossible. Indeed, that caution never did a thing to augment success, because success never came to pass. Resolved I may be that mine was a life gustily pursued, riches admirably attained and so forth, but the resolution is a murky one nonetheless. Failure wears many guises, and I have worn them all.</i><br><i>The sun&#x2019;s gilded gift enlivens this airy repose, as I sit, an old man smelling of oil and ink, scratching with this worn quill whilst the garden whispers on all sides and the nightingales crouch mute on fruit-heavy branches. Oh, have I waited too long? Bones ache, twinges abound, my wives eye me from the shadows of the colonnade with black-tipped tongues poking out from painted mouth, and in the adjudicator&#x2019;s office the water-clock dollops measured patience like the smacking of lips.</i><br><i>Well I recall the glories of the holy cities, when in disguise I knelt before veiled tyrants and god-kissed mendicants of the soul, and in the deserts beyond the crowded streets the leather-faced wanderers of the caravan tracks draw to the day&#x2019;s end and the Gilk guards gather in shady oases and many a time I traveled among them, the adventurer none knew, the poet with the sharp eyes who earned his keep unraveling a thousand tales of ancient days&#x2014;and days not so ancient, if only they knew.</i><br><i>They withheld nothing, my rapt listeners, for dwelling in a desert makes a man or woman a willing audience to all things be they natural or unnatural; while I, for all the wounds I delivered, for all the words of weeping and the joys and all the sorrows of love and death that passed my tongue, smooth as olives, sweetly grating as figs, I never let a single drop of blood. And the night would draw on, in laughter and tears and expostulations and fervent prayers for forgiveness (eyes ashine from my languid explorations of the paramour, the silk-drenched beds and the flash of full thigh and bosom) as if the spirits of the sand and the gods of the whirlwinds might flutter in shame and breathless shock&#x2014;oh no, my friends, see them twist in envy!</i><br><i>My tales, let it be known, sweep the breadth of the world. I have sat with the Toblai in their mountain fastnesses, with the snows drifting to bury the peeks of the longhouses. I have stood on the high broken shores of the Perish, watching as a floundering ship struggled to reach shelter. I have walked the streets of Malaz City, beneath Mock&#x2019;s brooding shadow, and set eyes upon the Deadhouse itself. Years alone assail a mortal wanderer, for the world is round and to witness it all is to journey without end.</i><br><i>But now see me in this refuge, cooled by the trickling fountain, and the tales I recount upon these crackling sheets of papyrus, they are the heavy fruits awaiting the weary traveler in yonder oasis.

Even the gods must wait spellbound.</i><br><i>Listen then, nightingale, and hold close and sure to your branch. Darkness abides. I am but a chronicler, occasional witness and teller of magical lies in which hide the purest truths.

She lives and teaches in Arizona.INTRODUCTION<br>&nbsp;<br>According to ancient earth-based traditions, a deep-seated spirituality has always been a part of food preparation. When cooking is combined with a ceremonial significance, it transforms an ordinary task into an extraordinary connection with the Divine Source. Without requiring any commitment to Wicca and its beliefs, <i>The Wicca Cookbook</i> offers ways to celebrate and honor the divinity in nature and each of us.<br><br>Wicca, also known as Witchcraft, the Craft, or simply the Old Religion, is a nature-based religion, close in ideology to Native American and shamanistic traditions. As an earth-centered religion, its origins predate Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Wicca comes from the Saxon root <i>wicce</i>, loosely translated as &#x201c;wise&#x201d; or &#x201c;to bend or shape the unseen forces.&#x201d; The knowledge of Wicca is derived from the movement of the sun, moon, and stars, and the cycles of the seasons.<br><br>No hard and fast rules exist in Wicca. It is not based on a degree or a set of beliefs but rather on a practice of aligning oneself with the natural forces of life. Wiccans honor and celebrate the female energy known as the Goddess in Her triple reflection of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone. Her Consort, the male energy known as the God, Hunter, or Horned One, completes the total being of the Divine Source. Emphasis is placed on personal experience and a tolerance of other paths and lifeways. Wiccans recognize the innate presence of divinity in the natural world, each individual, and the cycle of the seasons.<br><br>Within Wicca are eight sabbats, each holding a sacrosanct place on the Great Solar Wheel of the Year, also known as the Mandala of Nature. The sabbats give way to each other like the changing of the seasons. Each sabbat is celebrated with corresponding symbols, traditional foods, herbs, and the ritual invocation of Divine power through the creation of sacred space.<br><br><i>The Wicca Cookbook</i> is divided into these nature-based festivals. Each recipe is preceded with a hallowed meaning, the ingredients&#x2019; therapeutic value, historical significance, or a spell or ritual that you can perform in conjunction with the food preparation. Great value is placed on personal creativity, poetry, and the artful integration of different myths and ritual elements. Therefore, you are encouraged to add to or create a ceremony or meditation that reflects your feelings and understanding.<br><br>The recipes include many edible flowers and medicinal herbs, whose use dates back to the Middle Ages and even earlier, when ancient people included them in recipes as well as used them for their healing and medicinal properties. Except for those few that were grown locally, most herbs were quite costly in the Middle Ages and protected with tenacity. Only the lady of the household held the key to the herb cabinet, since the servants were not to be trusted with such a precious commodity. The village midwife held the secrets to the curative uses of the flowers and herbs and the lore was then passed down through the generations.<br><br>Meals were heavily spiced to add flavor to otherwise bland food and in an attempt to cover up the unsavory taste of decaying food. Flowers and herbs were also used in dishes to impart both flavor and beneficial medicinal effects. The fragrances and textures of herbs and flowers delighted the senses. Their importance can be seen in the many treatises on gardening that have survived from the Middle Ages. Eighty-six plants are listed in a fifteenth-century treatise on gardening, and the author clearly indicates that he could have added more. Herbs have long been considered essential for a full and happy life.<br><br>Each flower and herb possesses unique characteristics that not only enhance the flavor but also add a sacred quality that imparts the Divine in every dish. By inviting Mother Nature into your dishes, you welcome the flow of Divine spirituality. In this cookbook, herbs and flowers from the Mother&#x2019;s garden are used in recipes during sabbats that coincide with their seasonal peak. This alignment increases the spiritual benefit of the recipe and reflects the Universe&#x2019;s perfect rhythm. Eating foods at their prescribed times not only offers more nutrients, it also ensures heightened medicinal potency.<br><br>You may either grow your own herbs and edible flowers or purchase them. A delightful kitchen herb garden conveys the message of Divine abundance. It reminds one of the wealth that is available to us all in the natural world. The recipes in <i>The Wicca Cookbook</i> call for fresh herbs, but in most cases you may substitute dried ones. When substituting dried herbs for fresh ones, halve the required measurement of fresh herbs to get the desired amount of herbs. You may even choose to grow your own herbs and dry them for your culinary purposes. (See Growing and Using Herbs, beginning on page 23, for suggestions on harvesting, drying, and preserving herbs.) If you do not have the time or means to cultivate your own garden, you can obtain medicinal herbs from various seed and nursery companies that specialize in growing herbs. In addition, we encourage you to grow flowers specifically for culinary purposes. If this is not possible, be sure to purchase flowers that are organically grown and free of pesticides.<br><br>Cook with as many whole foods as you can obtain. The way in which you create the recipes will reflect your personal spirituality and love. This individuality is vitally important in Wicca. So create and enjoy! Wicca adores and praises our uniqueness. The Old Religion revels in individualism, recognizing that every one of us is a perfect child of the Universe and created from the same Divine Source. This Divinity is both male and female; however, to reestablish our connection with the earth and the Mother energy and since the feminine power is considered the beginning of all creation, the place from which all life originates, Wiccans often say Mother or Goddess when referring to the Divine Source. We always remain a part of that source, just as the rays of sunshine never leave the sun. &#x201c;We have not left that Source to enter a body and die,&#x201d; explains <i>A Course in Miracles</i>. We are a life, a spirit having a body for a time, not a body having a life. As such, we each have something miraculous and Divine to offer. Today too many people do not recognize the Divine in everything and everyone. They only see the Divine in extraordinary events, miracles not to be expected every day, whereas Wiccans know magic is commonplace and happens throughout the natural world, manifesting in the smallest acts from hour to hour, day to day, season to season.<br><br>Wiccans take part in ceremonies and rituals as a means of performing white magic for healing purposes. White magic is positive and used only to promote good and healing. The innate good within Wiccan magic transforms negativity, allowing the old to die and make room for the new. The cyclical change of the seasons in nature and human life is seen as the essential erotic dance of life, death, and rebirth. New growth comes from death and destruction of old ideas, past pain, and bad habits, just as the greenest plants grow best from a pile of compost.<br><br>Each ceremony is as unique as the Wiccan performing it. Some ritual items are common to almost every Wiccan tradition, such as the <i>athame</i> (ritual knife) and <i>chalice</i> (ritual cup). Other tools that you may want to incorporate into your realm of magic could include bells, a Book of Shadows (a secret diary of spells, rituals, or dreams), a <i>besom</i> (broom), a <i>burin </i>(engraving tool), candles, cauldrons, cords, crystals, drums, incense, jewelry, special plates, pentacles, rattles, rune stones, scourges, statues, swords, staves, tarot cards, and wands. But it will be your own personality that adds a unique dimension to each magical incantation, providing the meaning and resonance. The tools just enhance the process and help you focus.<br>The key to building power within your tools and manifesting that which you desire is to use your ritual items often. These tools will help you connect with the Mother when you are feeling detached and alone. Place them where you see them every day. Many Wiccans choose to create an altar where they can arrange their most sacred items. An altar offers a refuge for meditation, relaxation, and observance. You can also place your ritual items throughout the house, reminding you at every turn that the Mother is waiting to shower you with her love and guidance. With regular use, your tools will soon be charged with your unmatched energy and ready for the next ritual.<br><br>When you perform rituals, you will be invoking sacredness into being. Whether you are holding ritual ceremonies, casting spells, or working with symbols, always keep a positive goal in mind. One commonly held Wiccan belief is the threefold law: Whatever you do comes back to you three times. The first rule of all Wiccan traditions is &#x201c;Harm to None.&#x201d; Wicca is truly a joyous religion with a reverence for the benevolent Divine Source who gives lovingly in abundance.<br><br>Rituals remind us of the deep spirituality found in everyday life as well as in sacred ceremony. Rituals recognize and honor the moon, the sun, the Goddess, the God, the sabbats, and more. They offer guidelines for honoring the changing seasons, planetary cycles, and the Mother. All Wiccan rituals welcome a personal touch as each practitioner contemplates the higher power within and surrounding them. Through rituals, Wiccans work magic that takes them beyond the human limitations of mind and substance, creating a sacred connection with Spirit.<br><br>This is not to say one must deny or disregard desires of the flesh. Spell casting for material gain or comfort is a legitimate manifestation of the Divine. We are put here on this earth plane to learn lessons of the highest order such as forgiveness, trust, and the gift of life, but we must still thrive on the material level. When we prosper and flourish, we illustrate to the world the many forms of abundance available to us all. As the faery saying goes, &#x201c;Work for yourself, and soon you will see that Self is everywhere.&#x201d; By casting a spell, we tell the Universe it is okay to send us our most fervent desires. We <i>will</i> it to happen, and as long as it is in the highest good of all concerned, the Universe complies. We are in charge of our own destiny; we create our own reality. When we look deep within, we see that the Divine Universe is not outside of ourselves, but within us. This revelation is so profound and expansive that Wiccans utilize rituals and symbols to conceive its vastness. It is when you stop trying to understand through the commonplace and the five senses that these rituals and symbols open up those channels of understanding and propel you toward enlightenment and personal growth.<br><br>Symbols speak volumes to our unconscious mind of things that cannot be explained, defined, or fully comprehended with our everyday language. They represent concepts that extend far beyond human understanding. Wiccan symbols provide a point of reference, a wider awareness for &#x201c;that-which-cannot-be-told,&#x201d; and allow infinite interpretations of experience, especially those in which one feels the connectedness to Spirit. Symbols speak of love and the universal and eternal intelligence that is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. Symbols put us in touch with our younger selves, when we never doubted out intimate relationship with the Universe. Therefore, they are essential for recognizing and remembering the love the Mother holds for all Her children. <br><br>Symbols hold a place in magical history as well. Often symbols were used to hide the workings of ancient people from a populace afraid of self-sufficient women. Many people had moved so far away from their natural roots that they deemed women who practiced the Old Religion evil witches. The pentagram, ankh, and symbols of the Goddess and the moon in Her many phases were carved into woodworking, sewn onto robes, or engraved onto chalices and athames. These symbols provided identification amongst fellow worshipers, which enabled them to maintain anonymity from the society at large.<br><br>You need not belong to a coven of witches to practice these age-old traditions: you just need to believe that something wiser and older than you is working in harmony with nature. Through heightened consciousness&#x2014;seeing the life force in everything&#x2014;you can direct nature&#x2019;s gifts for your highest good as well as for that of others.<br><br>To ensure the most potent kitchen magic, we suggest that you consecrate your kitchen, stove, and utensils. Consecrating your tools is a means of purifying them from past energies and intent and infusing them with your vibrations and purpose. If this ritual seems complicated, we invite you to create your own for manifesting a sacred environment that feels right for you.<br><br>Place a pentacle on your kitchen counter. A pentacle is a physical representation of the pentagram, a five-pointed star, which symbolizes the four elements in balance with Spirit. Fill a chalice or other cup with water. The chalice is symbolic of the receptive passivity of the Mother&#x2019;s womb. With your finger or an athame, draw three pentagrams in the air over the chalice and say<br>&nbsp;<br><i>I purify thee, O Element of Water,</i><br><i>And cast out from thee</i><br><i>All impurities and negativity.</i><br><i>By My Will so Mote it Be.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Place a pinch of salt on the pentacle.

Not only adventures, they were the salvation of her marriage. In college she had juggled four boyfriends, and only one of them, a mathematics graduate student named Leo Friedgood, had known of the existence of the others. Leo had seemed amused by her secretiveness, as he was amused by her private school nickname. Only after several months did Stony realize the extent to which amusement masked arousal.</p><p>She married him just after graduation&#x2014;no graduate school for Stony, and no more for Leo, who shaved his beard and bought a suit and took a job with Telpro Corporation, which had an office in Santa Monica.</p><p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1969</b></i></p><p>Tabby Smithfield grew to the age of five in an enormous stone house in Hampstead, Connecticut, with four acres of well-tended ground and a burglar alarm on the front gates. The neighborhood, consisting of sixteen houses along Long Island Sound, was impressive enough to attract its own tourists; perhaps six cars a day trolled down Mount Avenue, the drivers and passengers leaning to glimpse the mansions behind the gates. Locally, Mount Avenue was &#x201c;The Golden Mile,&#x201d; though it was twice longer than that; it was the original road between Hillhaven, the Victorian suburb of Patchin, and Hampstead. Mount Avenue, the site of the original farm settlements of Hampstead and Hillhaven, had once been the principal coaching road north to New Haven, but its hectic days were long past. Manufacturers with plants in Bridgeport or Woodville, a doctor, and the head of Patchin County&#x2019;s biggest legal practice lived in the impressive houses, along with others like them, older people who wished no excitement in their private lives. Tourists rubbernecking along the Golden Mile rarely saw them&#x2014;there might be a visiting movie star taking the sea-laden air along the coastal road or a college president pausing for breath before he made his pitch for funds, but the owners of the houses were invisible.</p><p>Outside the gray stone house, however, those taking a fast peek through the opened gates in 1969 might have seen a tall dark-haired man in tennis whites playing with a small boy. Perhaps a uniformed nanny would have been hovering on the steps before the front door, her posture inexplicably tense. And perhaps the boy&#x2019;s posture too would have seemed awkward, inhabited by the same tension, as if little Tabby Smithfield were half-aware that he was not supposed to be playing with his father. They make an oddly static and incomplete scene, father and son and nanny. They are badly composed: one figure is missing.</p><p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1964</b></i></p><p>Stony Friedgood&#x2019;s first affair after her marriage was in 1964, with the husband of a friend, a neighbor in their neat row of tract houses: he was unlike Leo, being jovial and blond and easygoing, a very junior banker, and Leo invariably spoke of him with contempt. This affair endured only two months.</p><p>Stony&#x2019;s delicate face, which was sharp-featured and framed in shining brown hair, became familiar in galleries and art museums, in certain bars at certain times. Considered from a utilitarian point of view, one neither Stony&#x2019;s nor Leo&#x2019;s parents could have understood, the Friedgoods had a successful marriage. By the time Leo was promoted twice and transferred to Telpro&#x2019;s New York offices, their income had doubled and Stony weighed only a pound more than when she was a student at Scripps. She left behind her yoga classes, a half-completed gourmet-cooking course, four unused tickets to a concert series, the undigested and already vague memories of six or seven men. Leo left nothing at all behind&#x2014;the company paid to ship east his sailboat and the eight cases he called his &#x201c;cellar.&#x201d;</p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1968</b></i></p><p>Monty Smithfield, his grandfather, was the great figure in Tabby&#x2019;s early childhood. It was Monty who kissed him first when he returned from nursery school, and Monty and his mother took him to his first haircut. Birthdays and Christmases Monty gave him stupefying presents, vast train sets and every possible sort of preschool vehicle from walkers to Big Wheels, even a dwarf pony stabled at a riding school. This was presented with much fanfare at Tabby&#x2019;s third birthday. August, 1968. Monty had provided a party for twenty children, a band playing Beatle songs and tunes from Disney movies, an ice sculpture of a brontosaurus&#x2014;Tabby loved dinosaurs then, and only evolution kept Monty Smithfield from buying his grandson a baby monster. &#x201c;Come on, Clark,&#x201d; called the jubilant old man as the gardener led out the shaggy little pony. &#x201c;Mount your son on this great beast.&#x201d; But Clark Smithfield had gone inside to his bedroom and was at that moment whacking a tennis ball against the elaborate headboard with a well-worn Spaulding racket, trying to chip the paint off one of the wooden curlicues.</p><p>Like any child, Tabby had no idea of what his father did for a living, no idea that there was a living to be earned. Clark Smithfield was at home four or five days every week, playing his rock records in the living room of their wing of the big house, going out to tennis matches whenever he could. If at the age of three or four Tabby had been asked what his father did, he would have answered that he played games. Clark never took him to the company of which he was a nominal vice-president; his grandfather did, and showed him off to the secretaries, announcing that here was the future chairman of the board of Smithfield Systems, Inc. Before he showed Tabby the computer room, the old man opened a door and said, &#x201c;For the record, this is your father&#x2019;s office.&#x201d; It was a small dusty room containing an almost bare desk and many photographs of Tabby&#x2019;s father winning college tennis tournaments; also a Richard Nixon dart board, as dusty as everything else. &#x201c;Does my daddy work here?&#x201d; Tabby asked with sweet innocence, and one of the secretaries snickered. &#x201c;He <i>does</i>,&#x201d; Tabby insisted valiantly. &#x201c;He <i>does</i> work here. Look! He plays tennis here!&#x201d; A spasm of distaste passed over Monty Smithfield&#x2019;s tidy features, and the old man did not smile for the remainder of the tour.</p><p>Whenever his father and grandfather were in the same room&#x2014;at the family dinners Clark could not avoid, at any occasion when Monty came into his son&#x2019;s living quarters&#x2014;an almost visible atmosphere of dislike frosted the air. At these times Tabby saw his father shrink to a child only slightly older than himself. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you like Grandpa?&#x201d; he asked his father once, when Clark was reading him a bedtime story. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s too complicated for you,&#x201d; Clark sighed.</p><p>At times, more frequently as he grew closer to five, Tabby heard them fighting.</p><p>Clark and his father argued about the length of Clark&#x2019;s hair, about Clark&#x2019;s aspirations as a tennis player (which his father scorned), about Clark&#x2019;s attitude. Clark and Monty Smithfield normally kept a cool distance from each other, but when Monty decided to harangue his son, they shouted&#x2014;in the dining room, in both living rooms, in the hallway, on the lawn. These arguments always ended with Clark storming away from his father.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d; Monty called out to him after a wrangle Tabby witnessed. &#x201c;Leave home? You can&#x2019;t <i>afford</i> to&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t <i>get</i> another job.&#x201d;</p><p>Tabby&#x2019;s face went white&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t understand the words, but he heard the scorn in them. That day he did not speak until dinnertime.</p><p>Clark&#x2019;s wife and mother were the glue that held the two families in their uneasy harmony: Monty genuinely liked Jean, Tabby&#x2019;s mother, and Jean and her mother-in-law kept Clark in his job. Maybe if Clark Smithfield had been either a twenty-percent-better tennis player than he was, or a twenty-percent-worse one, the misery in the old house on Mount Avenue would have dissipated. Or if he had been less intransigent, his father less adamant. But Jean and her mother-in-law, thinking that the passage of time would reconcile Clark to his job and Monty to his son, kept the families together. And so they stayed, in their sometimes almost comfortable antagonism. Until the first truly terrible thing that happened to Tabby and his family.</p><p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>1975</b></i></p><p>The Friedgoods, who appeared to be a model couple, moved to a builder&#x2019;s colonial in Hampstead in 1975, when Tabby Smithfield was ten years old and living with his father and stepmother in South Florida. As Leo Friedgood was on his way upward into the world he coveted, Clark Smithfield appeared to be running out his meager luck: he had a job as a bartender, quit that to take a job as salesman for Hollinsworth Vitreous, was fired from that when he got drunk on the yacht belonging to the president of the company and vomited on Robert Hollinsworth&#x2019;s carpet-weave slippers, did another stint tending bar, and took a job as a security guard. He worked nights and nipped from a bottle whenever his round took him back to the security station. Like his first wife, his mother was also dead&#x2014;Agnes Smithfield had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage one warm May morning as she discussed the installation of a rock garden with the groundsman and her life had fled before her body struck the ground. Monty Smithfield had sold his big house on Mount Avenue and moved with the housekeeper and cook into a house called &#x201c;Four Hearths&#x201d; on Hermitage Road, five minutes inland. His end of Hermitage Road was only two wooded hilly blocks from the place the Friedgoods bought.</p><p>Leo was now a division vice-president for Telpro, making nearly fifty thousand dollars a year; he bought his suits at Tripler, grew a thick aggressive mustache and let his hair get long enough to be bushy. Always fleshy, he had put on twenty extra pounds despite a daily mile-long jog, and now&#x2014;arrogant eyes, dark mustache and unrestrained hair&#x2014;he had the faintly lawless, buccaneerlike appearance of many a corporate executive who sees himself as a predator in a jungle full of predators.</p><p>In 1975, the first year on Cannon Road in Hampstead, Stony joined New Neighbors, High Minds&#x2014;a book discussion group&#x2014;the League of Women Voters and a cooking class, the YMCA, and the library. She would have looked for a job, but Leo did not want her to work. She would have tried to get pregnant, but Leo, whose own childhood was an epic of maternal bullying, became irrational when she tried to discuss it. In the <i>Hampstead Gazette</i> she read an ad for a yoga class and quit the New Neighbors. Soon after, she left High Minds and the League too.</p><p>The <i>Hampstead Gazette</i> came twice weekly. The little tabloid was Stony&#x2019;s chief source of information about her new town. From it she learned of the Women&#x2019;s Art League, and joined that, thinking she would meet painters&#x2014;one of the boys in California had been a painter. And because she wanted to, of course she did. Pat Dobbin was celebrated locally, neither especially good nor bad; he lived alone in a small house in the woods; he did illustrations&#x2014;these much better than his paintings&#x2014;to make a living. During one of Leo&#x2019;s business trips, she attended an Art League dinner with the painter: she was aware that the midge-sized red-haired woman carrying a notebook was Sarah Spry, author of the weekly social column &#x201c;What Sarah Saw&#x201d; in the <i>Gazette</i>, but was not prepared to see this item in the next week&#x2019;s column:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Sarah Saw:</i> Thistown&#x2019;s brilliant painter and illustrator PAT DOBBIN (can&#x2019;t say enough about the boy! Caught his stunning new abstract seascapes at PALMER GALLERY yet?) at the Women&#x2019;s Art League bash parading in elegant black tie and showing off a lovely mystery woman. Who&#x2019;s the unknown beauty, Pat? Fess up and tell Sarah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Leo returned from his trip, he read this paragraph and asked, &#x201c;Did you enjoy the Art League thing Friday night? Too bad I couldn&#x2019;t have gone with you.&#x201d; His eyes were bright and ironic.</p><p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>November 1970</b></i></p><p>Unlike her husband, Jean Smithfield was a careful driver. When she and Clark left their son with his grandparents for an evening, she always insisted on driving home if Clark went over his normal limit of two drinks before dinner and a couple of glasses of wine while they ate. On nights when Clark complained more than usually about his father or reminisced through ancient tennis matches, she drove home even if it meant listening to Clark railing about her relationship with his father. He would say, &#x201c;You actually <i>like</i> that old buzzard! Do you know what that does to me? Christ, sometimes I think he turns you on&#x2014;all those pinstripe suits get to you, don&#x2019;t they? You dig white hair. You don&#x2019;t have any more loyalty to me than to let the old man&#x2019;s phony charm get to you.&#x201d; If Clark were really bad, he&#x2019;d pass out before they pulled through the gates. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll never get Tabby,&#x201d; he would mutter. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll never forget I existed and make Tabby into his son. One thing he&#x2019;ll never do.&#x201d; Jean did her best to ignore this ranting.</p><p>They usually ate at a French restaurant up toward Patchin on the Post Road. One night in late November in 1970, Jean took a dollar from her bag as they went outside and stationed herself where the valet could see her. &#x201c;I can drive,&#x201d; Clark grumped. &#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; she said, and gave the bill to the boy when he got out of their car. &#x201c;We ought to have a goddamned Mercedes,&#x201d; Clark said as he let himself into the passenger seat. &#x201c;All it takes is money,&#x201d; she informed him.</p><p>Jean pulled out across the oncoming lane and pointed the car toward Pigeon Lane, the next traffic light.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s at it again,&#x201d; Clark muttered. &#x201c;He wants to send Tabby to the Academy&#x2014;public school isn&#x2019;t good enough for his grandson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You went to the Academy,&#x201d; Jean said.</p><p>&#x201c;Because my father could <i>afford</i> it!&#x201d; Clark screamed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you get the point, dammit? I&#x2019;m Tabby&#x2019;s father, dammit, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Jean was looking at him and she saw his face go slack as the sentence died away. Clark no longer looked angry or drunk. He looked worried.</p><p>She snapped her head forward and saw a station wagon sliding across the dividing line, coming toward them. <i>Ice</i>, she thought, <i>a patch of</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Move it!&#x201d; Clark shouted. And Jean twisted the wheel to the right. Another car which had pulled out of the restaurant just behind them struck her left-rear bumper so hard that Jean&#x2019;s hands flew off the steering wheel.</p><p>The station wagon, which had been going nearly fifty miles an hour before it struck the slick of ice, slammed straight into her door. Jean Smithfield tried to say &#x201c;Tabby&#x201d; before she died, but the door had crushed her chest and she did not have time.</p><p>In the mansion on Mount Avenue, her son woke up screaming.</p><p>The nineteen-year-old driver of the station wagon fell out of his car and tried to crawl away across the frozen road. He was bleeding from his scalp. Clark Smithfield, completely unharmed, took one look at his wife and threw up in his lap. Then he got out of the car and fell to his knees. Clark saw the boy who had killed his wife and yelled at him to stop. He struggled to his feet. The boy sat up twenty feet...</p></p><h2>Grace: A Novel</h2><p>A heartwarming and inspirational Christmas novel in the tradition of <i>The Christmas Box, The Gift</i>, and <i>The Christmas List</i>.

There is Christmas music playing from the radio in the other room. Mitch Miller's "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town." It's a little late, I think; Santa's come and gone, as have our children and grandchildren. They've left an impressive mess in their wake, but I don't care. As I get older I've come to treasure any evidence of family. Snow is falling outside and all is peaceful and still. In such moments it is possible to believe that the world could still be good.</p><p>Something profound happened to me today. It started innocently enough -- as most life-changing experiences do -- with a request from my grandchildren to read them a Christ-mas story, "The Little Match Girl." I've never been a fan of the tale, but, like most grandparents, I'm not one to deny my grandchildren. As I read to them, something happened to me; by the end of the story I was crying. Four-year-old Ebony Brooke tried to console me. "It's okay, Grandpa," she said. "It's just a story."</p><p>It's not just a story, there really was a little match girl and she changed my life in ways I'm still trying to understand. Even the grandchildren sitting before me wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. As important as she is to me, I've never shared her story. It's finally time that I did.</p><p>My memory, like my eyesight, has waned with age and I pray I can get the story right. Still, there are things that become clearer to me as I grow older. This much I know: too many things were kept secret in those days. Things that never should have been hidden. And things that should have.</p><p>Who was she? She was my first love. My first kiss. She was a little match girl who could see the future in the flame of a candle. She was a runaway who taught me more about life than anyone has before or since. And when she was gone my innocence left with her.</p><p>There is pain in bringing out these memories. I suppose I don't really know why I feel compelled to write at this time, only that I am. Maybe I want those closest to me to finally know what has driven me for all these years. Why, every Christmas, I occasionally slip away into my thoughts to someplace else. Or maybe it's just that I still love her and wonder, after all this time, if I can still find grace.</p><p>Copyright � 2008 by Richard Paul Evans</p></p><h2>The Question of Bruno: Stories</h2><p>In this stylistically adventurous, brilliantly funny tour de force-the most highly acclaimed debut since Nathan Englander's-Aleksander Hemon writes of love and war, Sarajevo and America, with a skill and imagination that are breathtaking.<br><br>A love affair is experienced in the blink of an eye as the Archduke Ferdinand watches his wife succumb to an assassin's bullet. An exiled writer, working in a sandwich shop in Chicago, adjusts to the absurdities of his life. Love letters from war torn Sarajevo navigate the art of getting from point A to point B without being shot. With a surefooted sense of detail and life-saving humor, Aleksandar Hemon examines the overwhelming events of history and the effect they have on individual lives. These heartrending stories bear the unmistakable mark of an important new international writer.</p><p>Aleksandar Hemon moved to the U.S. from Bosnia in the early 1990s, prior to the siege of Sarajevo. He swiftly learned English and began writing, in his adopted language, stories about the traumas of immigrant experience and the pain of witnessing the war from his American exile. His impressive debut, <i>The Question of Bruno</i>, may lack the fluency and imaginative �lan of Kundera and the linguistic density and sophistication of Conrad (both of whom Hemon specifically invokes), yet these stories have a haunting power that lingers long after a first reading. <p> By turns tragic and darkly comic, the stories are a mixed bag in terms of style. They are unified, however, by theme. In "Islands," for example, a boy and his family visit their Uncle Julius on the island of Mljet, which is infested by the very mongooses that were imported to deal with the snake problem. Julius, veteran of a Stalinist prison camp, takes a stoical tack: "So that's how it is, he said, it's all one pest after another, like revolutions." And when the family returns to Sarajevo, they are greeted by their neglected, starved cat, shaking "with irreversible hatred." The hungry feline returns in another story, when we learn that Sarajevo under siege was filled with starving cats, which were eaten by starving dogs. If it's symbolism you're after, look no further.</p><p> One of the best stories, "The Sorge Spy Ring," wonderfully evokes a sad childhood spent in the shadow of Tito's cold war repressions. A man buys his son a portable telegraph set, and the two communicate in Morse code in the privacy of their own home--but later the father is arrested for espionage, and as Tito finally dies, he too languishes on his deathbed, weakly sucking a banana. The image is both poignant and pathetic. It's also the sort of tight close-up that Hemon loves (the camera and the television are dominant images, as one might expect from a writer who resorts to CNN to find out what's happening at home). There are moments when his language is slightly unidiomatic and offkey, as if he's leaned too heavily on a well-thumbed thesaurus. On the whole, though, this is an honest, vivid, and sometimes brilliant collection. <i>--Jonathan Allison</i></p>&#x201c;Not just an extraordinary storyteller but an extraordinary writer: one who seems not simply gifted but necessary.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br>&#x201c;By turns terrifying, gently comic and brutally satiric, these are stunning stories that compel the reader to view a world rendered ... abruptly alien and unfamiliar.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br><br></i>&#x201c;The man is a maestro....

At the heart of the story are three cousins whose different lives follow similar trajectories. Leaving welfare, Angie puts her heart in her work. Jewell bets on an imprisoned man. Opal guards a tragic secret that threatens her kids and her life. DeParle traces&nbsp; their family history back six generations to slavery and weaves poor people, politicians, reformers, and rogues into a spellbinding epic.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a vivid sense of humanity, DeParle demonstrates that although we live in a country where anyone can make it, generation after generation some families don&#x2019;t. To read American Dream is to understand why.</p></p><p>More than a decade after presidential candidate Bill Clinton floated the idea of ending "welfare as we know it," the changes to the system have become so accepted and entrenched that it is difficult to remember the heated controversy surrounding the issue of reform. Jason DeParle, a social policy reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>, forcefully brings the subject to life in <i>American Dream</i>, a moving and informed examination of the challenges, complexities, successes, and failures involved in fixing our nation's ailing welfare system. Tracing the lives of three women and their children as legislative changes are pushed through Washington and the state of Wisconsin, DeParle puts an extraordinarily human face on a subject that is too often prone to ideological oversimplification. As DeParle adeptly shows, their story "of adversity variously overcome, compounded, or merely endured ... embodies the story of welfare writ large."<p> The three compelling women at the heart of DeParle's narrative are vastly different temperamentally, yet they share the abstract qualities of strength and endurance, as well as extended family ties. DeParle paints their portraits with respect and sensitivity, and he provides a marvelous family history that reveals how "the story of welfare" is painfully "tangled in the story of race." Our glimpse at these difficult lives and the forces that profoundly shape them inspire an equal measure of hope and disappointment, and a large measure of outrage. As these remarkably resilient women struggle to raise their families, corruption is exposed in the very offices charged with implementing the newly adopted reforms. DeParle accepts that removing nine million women and children from the welfare rolls represents enormous progress. However, he simultaneously recognizes that we are dismally failing to confront a consequence of welfare reform: a new class of working poor. --<i>Silvana Tropea</i></p>"Jason DeParle's <i>American Dream</i> is a singular achievement. He interweaves a fascinating discussion of the politics of the welfare reform movement with a poignant portrayal of the lives of three women in one extended family who move on and off the welfare rolls in a struggle to survive. This is must reading for anyone concerned about the limitations of American social policy in addressing the problems of the urban poor." <br><br> William Julius Wilson, author of <i>The Truly Disadvantaged</i><br> Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University <br><br> "Jason DeParle's American Dream vividly reveals how public policy affecting the poor is conceived, marketed, enacted, and implemented. He shows what &#x2018;welfare reform&#x2019; does for those on high and what it does to those below who most directly feel the consequences of policies over which they have little influence. DeParle's book delivers its haunting news with a jolt. It informs us about the continuation of a dire national tragedy with a skillfulness that demands admiration." <br><br> Randall Kennedy<br> Professor, Harvard Law School <br><br> " In <i>American Dream</i>, Jason DeParle gives us a first-ever, penetrating look into the evolving consequences of the Clinton administration&#x2019;s so&#x2013;called "welfare reform" of 1996. DeParle&#x2019;s exceptional reporting takes us back to the intergenerational source of so much black poverty -- stretching back six generations in the Caples family and outlining how three members of this extended African American family, Angie, Opal and Jewell, have coped with the crises of urban poverty and demands of the welfare bureaucracy. We learn intimate details of the Caples&#x2019; struggles on the periphery of American life from slavery and subsequent sharecropping serfdom in the Mississippi Delta to the slums of Milwaukee in the early 1990s. The Epilogue ends in 2004 with Angie and Jewell, no longer on welfare and working, holding tightly onto one thin thread by which they may pull themselves into the American dream, while their "sister" Opal seems to have fallen far out of reach. <i>American Dream</i> is an extraordinary effort by an extraordinary journalist." <br><br> Leon Dash<br> Author of <i>When Children Want Children: The Urban Crisis in Adolescent Childbearing</i> and <i>Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America.</i> <br> <br> "No other journalist matches Jason DeParle&#x2019;s skill in showing the effects of social policy on real people. This is a book that will break your heart and open your mind. In the vividness of its characters and the sweep of its ambition, <i>American Dream</i> is the <i>Les Miserables</i> of our day. It follows three women on their journey into and out of the welfare system, but it does much more. It carries us through four generations of their ancestors&#x2019; history, to explain the origins of their poverty. And it brings us five years of political high drama, to explain the law that comes crashing into their lives. This book teems with humor, surprise, paradox, and redemption." <br><br> Helen Prejean<br> Author of <i>Dead Man Walking</i> <br><br> "With equal measure of compassion and dispassion, Jason DeParle confronts us inescapably with the reality of poverty in America. You cannot read this book and remain indifferent to those who are being left behind. This is one of the great works on social policy of this generation." <br><br> Daniel Schorr<br> Senior News Analyst<br> National Public Radio<br> <br> "In this beautifully written, heartfelt book, Jason DeParle has pulled off a stunning feat of journalistic storytelling. Equally at home in the West Wing as he is on the inner-city streets of Milwaukee, DeParle chronicles the story behind the most important piece of social policy to come along in decades, and its impact on real lives. With a novelist&#x2019;s eye for irony and detail, he is unflinching in his reporting. What he finds will surprise you. It did me. <i>American Dream</i> is a must read for anyone concerned about the fate of our poor." <br><br> Alex Kotlowitz<br> Author of <i>There Are No Children Here</i><br></p><h2>The Swiss Alpine Pass Route &#x2013; Via Alpina 1: Trekking East to West across Switzerland</h2><p><p>This guidebook presents the stunning Alpine Pass Route, a 360km (225 mile) long-distance trail that traverses Switzerland from east to west, from Sargans to Montreux on Lake Geneva (Lac L�man). Since the advent of Swiss national hiking routes and the European Via Alpina network, the route has been fully waymarked as Via Alpina 1, with a new start-point in Liechtenstein. This guide takes stock of changes to the original route and includes a 26km (16 mile) 'prologue' stage through Liechtenstein to the traditional start-point at Sargans, as well as alternative stages between Lenk and Montreux to follow the 'old' Alpine Pass Route via Gsteig rather than the VA1 via Gstaad.</p><p>The main route is described in 18 daily stages of 12.5-29km (8�-18 miles), with suggestions of ways in which public transport could be used to support a tighter itinerary than the 3 weeks recommended. Comprehensive route description is accompanied by 1:100,000 mapping and a wealth of advice for planning a successful trip, covering safety, transport, accommodation and language.</p><p>Crossing 16 passes as it threads its way through mountain and valley, the Via Alpina 1 gives hikers the opportunity to experience the beauty and exhilaration of the Swiss Alps, taking advantage of the region's excellent hiking infrastructure. From flower-strewn meadows to snow-capped peaks, the route boasts spectacular mountain vistas at every turn, with highlights including the majestic Wetterhorn, Eiger and Jungfrau.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Kev Reynolds is a freelance writer, photojournalist and lecturer.

In Design-Driven Innovation: How to Compete by Radically Innovating the Meaning of Products, Roberto Verganti introduces a third strategy, a radical shift in perspective that introduces a bold new way of competing. Design-driven innovations do not come from the market; they create new markets. They don't push new technologies; they push new meanings.<br><br>It's about having a vision, and taking that vision to your customers. Think of game-changers like Nintendo's Wii or Apple's iPod. They overturned our understanding of what a video game means and how we listen to music. Customers had not asked for these new meanings, but once they experienced them, it was love at first sight.<br><br>But where does the vision come from? With fascinating examples from leading European and American companies, Verganti shows that for truly breakthrough products and services, we must look beyond customers and users to those he calls "interpreters" - the experts who deeply understand and shape the markets they work in.<br><br>Design-Driven Innovation offers a provocative new view of innovation thinking and practice.<br></p><p><br>Roberto Verganti&#x2019;s fascinating analysis will stimulate all thoughtful business readers, students, and practitioners alike.

Fully grounded in sound literary and historical scholarship, the anthology takes a fresh approach to many canonical authors, and includes a wide selection of work by lesser-known writers. The anthology also provides wide-ranging coverage of the worldwide connections of British literature, and it pays attention throughout to matters such as race, gender, class, and sexual orientation. The full anthology comprises six bound volumes, together with an extensive website component; the latter is accessible by using the passcode obtained with the purchase of one or more of the bound volumes. </p> <p>A two-volume Concise Edition and a one-volume Compact Edition are also available. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Our Editorial Team:</strong><br> <br> <strong>Joseph Black</strong>, University of Massachusetts<br> <strong>Leonard Conolly</strong>, Trent University<br> <strong>Kate Flint</strong>, University of Southern California<br> <strong>Isobel Grundy</strong>, University of Alberta<br> <strong>Roy Liuzza</strong>, University of Tennessee<br> <strong>Jerome McGann</strong>, University of Virginia<br> <strong>Anne Prescott</strong>, Barnard College<br> <strong>Barry Qualls</strong>, Rutgers University<br> <strong>Claire Waters</strong>, University of California Davis </p><p>&#x201c;Since the publication of the first edition in 2006, the Broadview <em>Age of Romanticism</em> has outstripped all competitors in its cultural richness and array of conceptual offerings. This new third edition extends the lead in that area, with exciting new entries and course-ready units that help reframe key topics.... The Broadview provides great access to texts (thanks for <em>The Giaour</em> and <em>Castle Rackrent</em>!), but more than that, it is the kind of anthology that may shape innovative and necessary new thinking about the role played by Romantic literary, cultural, and material production at the onset of our contemporary world moment.&#x201d; &#x2015; Eric Lindstrom, University of Vermont </p> <p>&#x201c;I love the changes to the third edition! Adding excerpts from Macpherson&#x2019;s <em>Poems of Ossian</em> allows students to engage with one of the least accessible but most immediately influential texts of the Romantic era; likewise, adding Byron&#x2019;s <em>The Giaour</em> gives students a clearer sense of how the most charismatic Romantic poet established his reputation for dashing, exotic glamor.&#x201d; &#x2015; Evan Gottlieb, Oregon State University </p> <p>&#x201c;The new <em>Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Age of Romanticism</em> includes a range of rich contextual materials, including sections devoted to print culture, the gothic, slavery, and the sublime. These materials ... invite students to see beyond the anthology format and understand literature&#x2019;s interactions with technology, politics, and the environment. The editors have judiciously attended to the significant contributions of Irish and Scottish authors.... In addition, the anthology and the accompanying website document literature&#x2019;s role in shaping and critiquing the British Empire.&#x201d; &#x2015; JoEllen DeLucia, Central Michigan University </p> <p>&#x201c;... Finally, instructors and students of British Romanticism have an anthology that addresses our needs in the 21st century. There is a fine balance between male and female writers, and the plethora of ancillary material that is available through the text&#x2019;s website is unparalleled. The affordable price makes the Broadview the natural choice for instructors; I am excited to use it my classroom.&#x201d; &#x2015; Peter Francev, Victor Valley College </p> <p>&#x201c;This latest edition expands nicely on what has always been Broadview&#x2019;s strength: the sheer diversity of authors and works included. The (very few) significant works that I felt to have been missing in the previous edition&#x2019;s offerings have all now been included and the new material added to the &#x2018;Contexts&#x2019; sections is highly useful and relevant. Canonical authors are thoroughly represented, but the range of authors from outside both the conventional limits of the canon and the geographical limits of England now provides a much broader scope for the teaching of the Romantic period. As someone who is currently revising my courses in the period to make them less focused on individual authors, the flexibility offered by this anthology is very exciting.&#x201d; &#x2015; Nat Leach, Cape Breton University </p> <p>&#x201c;This anthology provides students with a fresh, extensive look at Romantic-period literature from the perspective of the most recent scholarship on the period without sacrificing fundamental texts. There is a healthy balance of canonical and non-canonical pieces, and the thematic approach used in the anthology provides students with a lens to help understand these texts within the framework of the global cultural debates that defined the Romantic period. The &#x2018;Contexts&#x2019; offered throughout the volume and the supplemental texts offered in the online supplement to the anthology provide both richness and balance so that students have multiple paths by which they can access the diversity that characterizes Romantic-era literature. The anthology offers students a look at the dynamism and modernity that make Romantic-era literature so engaging.&#x201d; &#x2015; Jennifer Golightly, University of Denver </p> <p>&#x201c;This is an anthology of remarkable breadth and depth, one that captures several of the various spirits of the Romantic Age. The integration of online supplementary material shows that material's relationship to the print selections, but the print version also stands on its own. The section on the Gothic, though brief, is particularly welcome and includes important primary and secondary source considerations of the nature of the Gothic and its relationship to the sublime.&#x201d; &#x2015; Jenny Crisp, Dalton State College </p> <p>Comments on <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em>: </p> <p>&#x201c;... an exciting achievement. It sets a new standard by which all other anthologies of British literature will now have to be measured.&#x201d; &#x2015; Graham Hammill, State University of New York, Buffalo </p> <p>&#x201c;I have been using <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em> for three years now. I love it&#x2015;and so do my students!&#x201d; &#x2015; Martha Stoddard-Holmes, California State University, San Marcos </p> <p>&#x201c;... a very real intellectual, as well as pedagogical, achievement.&#x201d; &#x2015; Nicholas Watson, Harvard University </p> <p>&#x201c;After twenty years of teaching British literature from the Norton anthologies, I&#x2019;m ready to switch to the Broadview. The introductions to each period are key to teaching a survey course, and those in the Broadview seem to me to be both more accessible to students and more detailed in their portraits of each era than are those of the Norton. And Broadview&#x2019;s selection of authors and texts includes everything I like to teach from the Norton, plus a good deal else that&#x2019;s of real interest.&#x201d; &#x2015; Neil R.

Although each partner is strong enough to stand alone, each needs the other for the acceptance all humans crave, for validation, for someone to trust with the erotic fantasies in their secret heart. As you play at D&amp;S, never forget that you are holding your partner's trust and fantasies in your hand, and extend around him the protective shield he needs at this time. Enjoy your time at the "top," but remember the one who put you there.Do you have a strange fascination with riding crops, even though you've never been on a horse?

Oneroad, a son of one of those families, was educated in the traditional ways and then sent east to obtain a college education, eventually becoming a Presbyterian minister. For most of his life, he moved in two worlds. By fortunate coincidence he met Alanson B. Skinner, a student of anthropology and kindred soul, in New York City. The two men formed a bond both personal and professional, collaborating on anthropological studies in various parts of the United States. The project closest to Oneroad's heart was the collection and preservation of the stories and traditions of the Sisseton and Wahpeton. Oneroad wrote down the stories and gave them to Skinner. The men intended to polish the resulting manuscript and publish it, but Skinner's untimely death in 1925 thwarted their plans.<br><br>Oneroad and Skinner collected descriptions of everyday life, including tribal organization, ceremonies that marked the individual's passage from birth to death, and material culture. Several of the folk tales included relate the exploits of Iktomi, the trickster, while others tell of adventures of such figures as the Child of Love, Star Born, and the Mysterious Turtle.<br><br>Laura L. Anderson, who teaches anthropology at the University of Oklahoma, found the neglected manuscript among Skinner's papers in a California library and has edited it for publication.

A tiny man makes his way back to a tiny car, with a tiny shopping bag: "Shopping for one again." Another office worker sits atop a gigantic engagement ring and gazes into the distance; the caption reads, simply: "No." These are the&nbsp;collected photographs of Slinkachu, a London-based artist who for several years has been placing tiny hand painted people on street corners, park benches, and the Underground, and leaving them to fend for themselves. Much like Banksy's early graffiti work, Slinkachu's creations mix the bustle, humor, and melancholy of city life, and lie quietly in the darker corners of London's streets, waiting to be discovered. And if you&#x2019;re lucky enough to find one, to quote <i>The Times</i>: "Oddly enough, even when you know they are just hand-painted figurines, you can't help but feel that their plights convey something of our own fears about being lost and vulnerable in a big, bad city." This volume also includes a forward from acclaimed novelist Will Self.</p><p><p>Slinkachu's work was featured in <i>Street Renegades: New Underground Art</i> and <i>Tactile: High Touch Visuals</i> and can be found&nbsp;at little-people.blogspot.com.

Every seminarian and church leader must wrestle with that question. No matter what designation a church uses to describe itself, it must also think critically about why it exists and what it should be doing. In this book, five leading voices representing a range of Christian traditions engage in an enlightening conversation as they present and compare their perspectives on the mission of the church. Each contributor offers his or her view and responds to the other four views. Contributors include Stephen&nbsp;B. Bevans, Darrell&nbsp;L. Guder, Ruth Padilla DeBorst, Edward Rommen, and Ed Stetzer. The book's format is ideal for classroom use and will also benefit pastors and church leaders.</p><p>Stephen&nbsp;B. Bevans, Darrell&nbsp;L.

There is a direct relationship between sailing efficiency and sailing fun. Knowing when, how, and why to trim your sails is the essence of sailing. If you understand trim, you understand sailing. <br> Plain Sailing also covers how to look at sails, how to distinguish good trim from bad, how to diagnose a blown-out sail, and much more. This book is essential reading for all beginning sailors, as well as for more experienced cruising sailors who want to get the most out of their boats.</p><p>Dallas Murphy is the author of Rounding the Horn and other books, and has been sailing seriously, cruising and racing inshore and off--including high-latitude cruises to Spitsbergen, East Greenland, Iceland, and Cape Horn--for thirty-five years. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;&#x2018;Relax. Sailing isn't all that difficult or mysterious,' says Dallas Murphy in this new and very different sailing manual. He covers sailing's most important skills and equipment without intimidating his readers and without dumbing-down his material. I heartily recommend Plain Sailing to any beginner or novice, and also to old salts needing a refresher course." (John Rousmaniere, Author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, A Berth to Bermuda, In a Class by Herself, and Fastnet, Force 10.)<br><br>"Murphy steers aspiring sailors though the maze of jargon and effortlessly explains basic sailing concepts.

Suddenly, Annie's young niece and nephew are left in their care.<p>Unprepared for the chaos that the two children inevitably bring, but nervously excited nonetheless, Annie finds the interruption of her normal life and her last chance at happiness complicated further by the attention being paid to Sarah by a local man with his eye on the farm.<br>&nbsp;<br>A summer of adventure, pain, delight, and, ultimately, epiphany unfolds for both the children and their caretakers in this poignant and exquisitely told story of innocence, loss, and reconciliation.<br></p></p><p>The central character in Sebastian Barry's novel <i>Annie Dunne</i> is a woman who has been pushed to the margins, a woman whom life has given few chances of happiness and fulfillment. Unmarried, she spends years as housekeeper for her brother-in-law because her sister is too ill to manage. Her sister dies, her brother-in-law remarries, and Annie Dunne is homeless. Invited by her cousin Sarah, she moves to a small farm in a remote part of Wicklow. As the novel opens, the two cousins share their lives and the work on the farm. It is the late 1950s and rural Ireland is changing around them. Annie's nephew heads for London in search of work and leaves his young children with their great-aunt. Content with her life with Sarah, Annie also finds a new capacity for love in her feelings for the two children. Yet even the small pleasures that Annie finds in her life are threatened. An unlikely suitor pays court to Sarah, and Annie's love for the children opens her up to pain almost as much as to happiness. <i>Annie Dunne</i> is a novel in which few external dramas occur--there is an accident with a pony and trap, one of the children goes temporarily missing--but Barry evokes superbly the inner dramas of his characters. In a society where emotions are often severely repressed and expressed only obliquely, small incidents hint at larger feelings and Barry has written a story in which these are subtly and poignantly unfolded. <i>--Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk</i>Sebastian Barry was born in Dublin in 1955.

He saw to it that little was known about him, to the point that some French journalists wondered if he existed at all. Even his most devoted clients&#x2015;Marlene Dietrich, Barbara Hutton, a clutch of Rothschilds&#x2015;never met him.</p><p>But one woman knew Balenciaga very well indeed. The first person he hired when he opened his Paris house was Florette Chelot, who became his top vendeuse. She witnessed the spectacular success of his first collection, and they worked closely for more than thirty years, until 1968, when Balenciaga abruptly closed his house without telling any of his staff. Youth-oriented fashion was taking over, Paris was in upheaval, and the elder statesman wanted no part of it.</p><p>In <i>The Master of Us All</i>, Mary Blume tells the remarkable story of the man and his world. Intimate and revealing, this is an unprecedented portrait of a designer whose vision transformed an industry but whose story has never been told until now.</p></p><p><p><b>Mary Blume</b>, a native New Yorker who lives in Paris, was a longtime columnist for the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>. She is the author of <i>C�te d'Azur: Inventing the</i> <i>French Riviera </i>and of a collection of her <i>Herald</i> <i>Tribune </i>pieces, <i>A French Affair.</i></p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Crist�bal Balenciaga: a beautiful name. <i>Elle</i> magazine rhapsodized in 1950 that the four syllables of &#x201c;Balenciaga&#x201d; simply burst forth upon the page (actually, there are five), while a contemporary poet sees in the name&#x2019;s &#x201c;swaying melody the flowing quality of Balenciaga&#x2019;s clothes and exquisite <i>justesse</i> of their proportions.&#x201d; It is a once-upon-a-time sort of name that should be part of a fable, and it is. <br>The setting is the humble fishing village of Getaria on Spain&#x2019;s Basque coast, between San Sebasti�n and Bilbao, the date early in the last century. The fairy tale has many versions, but let Pauline de Rothschild, the former Pauline Potter, begin: <br>In the center of a street made dark by the shadows of its thick stone houses, a woman was walking, her back turned to the light from the sea. She wore a pale, ankle length, silk shantung suit. The severe houses enclosed her, shuttered. <br>A boy was watching her. <br>She would come almost abreast of him, and he would run up a side-street of the fishing village, so closely carved into the mountain that its streets are as steep and narrow as Genoa&#x2019;s, some entirely made of steps. Down another he would run and be ahead of her again. <br>Then he would stare. <br>One day he stopped her, and asked if he could make a suit for her. The boy was about thirteen, with dark hair and darker eyes and the smile he would keep all his life. <br>&#x201c;Why do you want to do this?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Because I think I can,&#x201d; he answered. <br>The boy was Crist�bal Balenciaga&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>The woman was the old Marquesa de Casa Torres (or her daughter-in-law) and she was wearing a white (or beige) Worth, Drecoll, Ceruit, or Redfern dress or suit, according to who is telling the tale. She was possibly on her way to (or from) Mass. The boy may have been as young as six (or as old as nineteen), and his father&#x2014;who had died of a heart attack or was drowned at sea&#x2014;was either a fisherman or the captain of the royal yacht. Cheeky young Crist�bal, the legend continues, copied her outfit so perfectly that the marquesa became his patron and took him while he was still in his teens to meet the great couturier Jacques Doucet in Paris. <br>Some of this is true. <br>But much of it isn&#x2019;t. The very plainness of plain fact has never seemed to fit someone so exotic as Balenciaga (as if the amazing could not spring from the quotidian), and so for decades the legends were embellished rather than investigated. Then a young Basque curator named Miren Arzalluz took the trouble to dig into official records and in 2010 published her findings about Balenciaga&#x2019;s family and early years. Myths, uncovered facts, and one&#x2019;s own instinct about the mix can finally make a coherent, if spare, whole. <br>Getaria, Balenciaga&#x2019;s birthplace, is a modest and handsome fishing village whose past as a whaling port brought it sufficient wealth to have as its center an oversize Gothic church, San Salvador, of surpassing gloom and considerable weirdness because its near-trapezoidal floor tilts noticeably up toward the altar. A statue near the city hall honors the local hero, Sebasti�n de Elcano, the first captain to circumnavigate the globe (as Magellan&#x2019;s second in command he took over when Magellan was killed in the Philippines), and new plaques mark the birthplaces of Balenciaga, in a tidy small house near the church, and the mother of Pl�cido Domingo, over an anchovy cannery. Getaria has excellent fish that restaurateurs grill in the street, and gray buildings whose sound proportions and straightness of line are bolder than the often-quaint Basque architecture of France. Even now Getaria has an air of provincial rectitude; its inhabitants provided San Sebasti�n, thirty kilometers along the coast, with fish and services when the Spanish king and his court went there each summer. <br>In about 1853, France&#x2019;s Empress Eug�nie, who was born in Spain, invented Biarritz as a fashionable resort. Following her example, in 1887, Queen Mar�a Cristina of Spain decided to make San Sebasti�n, across the border, the official summer home of the Spanish court. While Biarritz is dramatic and citified, San Sebasti�n is calmer and more elegant, with a wide seafront and restaurants that have made it a foodie mecca today. Friends in Paris were often surprised by the supposedly austere Balenciaga&#x2019;s pleasure in good eating, but he was Basque, and three existential questions, it is said, trouble the Basques each day: Where do we come from? Who are we? What are we going to have for dinner? <br>The last question results in excellent local cooking; the first two are harder. No one knows where the Basques come from&#x2014;even the prevalent blood type differs from that of other Europeans&#x2014;and they like to think of themselves as Europe&#x2019;s aborigines, their spiritual locus being an ancient oak tree in Guernica. The Basques&#x2019; language, Euskera, once believed to be the tongue spoken in the Garden of Eden, bears no relation to any other, and they group all the other languages in the world in one single dismissive word, Erdera. They are proud (by an ancient royal Spanish edict they are all aristocrats), deeply Catholic, and intractable. Crist�bal Balenciaga was definitely Basque. <br>The family was modest but respected: his father, a fisherman, served briefly as mayor of Getaria and rose to skipper the launch that was often used by the Spanish court, including the queen, in the summer season. His mother bore five children, two of whom died in infancy. Crist�bal, born in 1895, was the youngest; his sister, Agustina, and his brother, Juan Mart�n, remained his business associates in Spain throughout their lives. The older children were already at work when their father died after a stroke, leaving eleven-year-old Crist�bal alone to help out his mother, Martina Eizaguirre. <br>Well before her husband&#x2019;s death Martina was already giving sewing lessons to local girls and making dresses for private clients such as the Marquesa de Casa Torres, whose dressmaker she became a year before before Crist�bal was born. Hubert de Givenchy says that Balenciaga told him that his first attempt at design was to make a necklace for his cat (&#x201c;but since you can&#x2019;t make a cat lie on its back all the beads scattered&#x201d;), while a French magazine claims that he began by making a coat, including the legs, for his dog (presumably an early manifestation of his passion for sleeves). In any event the boy was at home with his mother, helping out, playing with scraps of fabric, and often going with her for fittings in the homes of summering aristocrats. <br>So the long-accepted legend of the meeting between the marquesa and the boy must be replaced by more convincing fact: he knew the marquesa and her home, just up the hill from the center of Getaria, from childhood. While he was helping his mother or playing with the marquesa&#x2019;s children, he took in her wardrobe and her fashion magazines and her well-chosen furnishings (the marqu�s owned paintings by Goya and Vel�squez), plugging naturally into the world of high style where he would spend his life. Not only could he study the Paris gowns his mother copied for summer use, but he could also learn to appreciate English tailoring and take in such novelties as department stores and buying by catalog, both of which the marquesa enjoyed. <br>Although he was never at ease with the French <i>gratin</i>, or upper crust, from her he picked up a comfortable familiarity with the Spanish aristocracy: it was of course Balenciaga who made the wedding dress of the marquesa&#x2019;s great-grandaughter, Fabiola, when she married the king of the Belgians in 1960, and a few years later one of his models was astonished to see, on the salon&#x2019;s white sofa, the taciturn Balenciaga laughing and chatting away with an elderly lady who turned out to be Victoria Eugenia, the former queen of Spain. <br>Through the marquesa, the twelve-year-old Balenciaga apprenticed with a San Sebasti�n tailor, then moved on to a tonier shop called New England, and to the new San Sebasti�n branch of the Grand Magasins du Louvre department store, which was patronized not only by the marquesa but by Mar�a Cristina, the dowager queen. By 1913 he was being sent to Paris as a buyer. After a short spell in Bordeaux to learn French, in 1918 he opened his first salon, C. Balenciaga, in San Sebasti�n, then went into a six-year partnership with two sisters who provided most of the backing. Balenciaga&#x2019;s investment was 7,362 pesetas and 25 c�ntimos, the 25 cents recalling that if his reputation was growing, his finances were still tight. When the six-year contract ended in 1924, he was able to open a new house, Crist�bal Balenciaga, gradually creating branches in Madrid and Barcelona under his name or under variations of Eisa, a reworking of his mother&#x2019;s maiden name. <br>The timing was just right. While most of Europe agonized in World War I, Spain, which remained neutral, flourished, especially San Sebasti�n, enriched by the wealth of Bilbao, a port and a banking and industrial center, and by the well-heeled of all nations who came to bask in its elegance and ease. Old-timers such as the duchess, who went to Paris each year to order 365 hats (366 in leap year), would disappear after the war, but the new crowd was avid and deeply attractive to Paris couturiers who, starting in l917, arrived with their collections. The major houses of Callot, Paquin, and Worth showed in such luxury hotels as the Maria Cristina, and Balenciaga saw, and possibly met, Chanel at San Sebasti�n&#x2019;s casino. Most important, he began a lifelong friendship with Madeleine Vionnet, the first designer to use the bias cut on the body of a dress, fashion&#x2019;s equivalent of inventing the wheel. <br>Balenciaga probably met Vionnet when she showed her collection to the Spanish court at San Sebasti�n in 1920. He was already buying her clothes for his shop on his Paris trips (a hasty working sketch on a piece of hotel stationery in the Arts D�coratifs archive in Paris also suggests that he was not above pinching her ideas), but when they met and she saw his work she encouraged him to create rather than adapt other people&#x2019;s designs. They shared a stubborn and exalted view of clothes as a sort of second skin that sculpts, rather than encases, the body: the couturier as a builder, not a decorator. They were both brilliant technicians, Balenciaga the more versatile in that he was as expert at tailoring coats and suits as at cutting soft fabrics, and both saw the designer as a craftsman dealing with clients and not as a remote artist. &#x201c;A couturier dresses human beings, not dreams,&#x201d; Vionnet would say. Their friendship lasted until Balenciaga&#x2019;s death, and when I met Vionnet in the late 1960s she was just back from a two-week stay in Balenciaga&#x2019;s country house near Orl�ans to recover from bronchitis and was wearing a floor-length bias-cut wool crepe skirt and matching vest that he had made for her in bright red (her own palette tended to shades of beige). <br>They were of equal historical importance&#x2014;if Dior later called Balenciaga &#x201c;the master of us all,&#x201d; he also said &#x201c;no one has carried the art of dressmaking farther than Vionnet&#x201d;&#x2014;but she was a generation older, having been born in 1876, and was already approaching glory when they met. Their clothes were dissimilar, Vionnet specializing in richly simple Greek-style folds, a deliciously errant vestal look, but they shared ardor and integrity&#x2014;&#x201c;a dress must be sincere,&#x201d; Vionnet said&#x2014;and had so intense an understanding of fabrics that neither of them liked to sketch. &#x201c;I hate sketching. Designers who sketch have no feeling for fabric,&#x201d; Vionnet said. Instead, she draped her fabrics on a wooden doll 31.5 inches tall, and Givenchy told me that when she was very old and bedridden and Balenciaga came to visit, she would show him something she had just confected on the doll with the wish that it might be useful to him. &#x201c;And Crist�bal, with that marvelous smile, would say to me, Isn&#x2019;t it adorable that at her age this woman would continue to work and give me her models,&#x201d; Givenchy said. &#x201c;He had until the end of his life someone who counted enormously for him, and that was Madame Vionnet.&#x201d; <br>To the young Balenciaga, Vionnet must have seemed like a favorite teacher, firm but kind, and indeed she had hoped to teach, but a neighbor pointed out to her father (her mother had run off) that further studies would mean more clothing bills, so at the age of ten she was yanked out of school and apprenticed to a dressmaker. &#x201c;If I had become a professor I would just have had a brain,&#x201d; she said many years later. &#x201c;Instead I discovered my hands and learned to love them.&#x201d; In England to pick up the language, she became an attendant in a lunatic asylum, then worked for five years in Kate Reilly&#x2019;s dressmaking establishment on Dover Street in London. Returning to Paris, she was engaged by the prestigious Callot Soeurs, then hired away by Jacques Doucet, a very grand designer and collector (he was an early patron of the furniture designer Eileen Gray and the first owner of <i>Les Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon</i>), in order to modernize his house. It was there that she discovered that the bias cut, a version of which had been used only to line garments, could give fabrics a new fluidity: &#x201c;I wanted it and found it,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;It seemed natural.&#x201d; The vendeuses, she added, hated it. In 1912 she opened her own modest house on the Rue de Rivoli and in 1923 got backing to become the first couturier on the Avenue Montaigne. <br>The House of Vionnet, at number 50, towered over its neighbors and triumphed in the architectural press as a perfect example of steel and glass Art Deco. It had 1,900 employees and 43 ateliers. While the grand salon of a house like Callot was heavy and crowded with furniture, Vionnet had a vast clean space framed with arches bordered in Lalique glass. When it came to opening his Paris house, Balenciaga followed Vionnet in keeping his public rooms simple and his private studio strictly off-limits. He did not follow Vionnet&#x2019;s more compassionate innovations&#x2014;a free staff cafeteria, medical service, and child care as well as classes for those who, like her, had had to leave school too young. Since he shared her loathing for copyists, having himself been one on a modest scale, he adopted her practice of photographing each model with its number, flat police lineup pictures, though he did not, like Vionnet, put his thumbprint on the label of every dress he made. <br>Vionnet was stronger and more authoritative than the young Balenciaga&#x2014;he would not have said &#x201c;I have never seen a fabric that refused to obey me,&#x201d; even though it was true&#x2014;and it was her strength and encouragement that helped him free his fantasy and develop his prodigious technique. <br>Discovering his talents, the young Balenciaga had great success&#x2014;by the age of twenty-one he is said to have dressed the queen of Spain&#x2014;and success brought a confidence he lost in his later days when his sole, and impossible, rival was his glorious self. After each new collection in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, people recalled, he would be tearful and tense because it hadn&#x2019;t been up to his standard. In all, it was a dog&#x2019;s life, he said after his retirement. But when he was young and imperfect, all he had to do was get better, and he did. <br>And he found love. Probably on a buying trip to Paris he met a charming and well-connected young man with sleek dark hair, Wladzio Jaworowski d&#x2019;Attainville, with whom he would live for some twenty years. D&#x2019;Attainville was Polish-French; his mother, according to a story in American <i>Vogue</i> in the 1940s, entertained in style and was photographed grandly under a portr...</p><h2>Dor L&#39;Dor Timeline: A Year-by-Year Graphic Timeline of Jewish History from Creation to the Present</h2><p><p>Jewish history takes on a whole new look in this graphic, year-by-year volume of illustrated, full-color, timeline charts that lead you on an expansive journey from creation to the present day.</p> <br><p><b>Dor L Dor</b> (Generation to Generation) offers a unique approach that provides a sweeping overview of all Jewish history - at a glance.

You&#x2019;re always on the lookout for new bands, and you have strong opinions when it comes to music debates, like Beatles vs. Stones. For years, you&#x2019;ve listened to guys talk about all things music, but the female perspective has been missing. Until now. <br><br>Drawing on her personal life as a music enthusiast, as well as her experience working at MTV and in radio, Courtney E. Smith explores what music can tell women about themselves&#x2014;and the men in their lives. She takes on a range of topics, from the romantic soundtracks of Romeo and Juliet to the evolution of girl bands. She shares stories from her own life that shed light on the phenomenon of guilty pleasures and the incredible power of an Our Song. Along the way, she evaluates the essential role that music plays as we navigate life&#x2019;s glorious victories and its soul-crushing defeats. Finally, here is a voice that speaks to women&#x2014;because girls get their hearts broken and make mix tapes about it, too. <br><br>&#x201c;Courtney Smith has smarts and sass in spades. Her insights are as hilarious as they are thoughtful, and when you finish reading this book, you&#x2019;ll feel like you just got home from a perfect night out with your best friend. And you&#x2019;ll want to listen to Prince. At full volume.&#x201d; &#x2014;Megan Jasper, Executive Vice President, Sub Pop Records <br></p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Courtney Smith</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q:</strong>What do you want readers to take away from <i>Record Collecting for Girls</i>? </p><p><strong> A:</strong> I want people to really think about what music they like, how they listen to it, and why. I would like them to end up feeling even closer to the music they love, and discovering things they had no idea they loved because something prompted a spark. After someone reads "Top Five Lists," I love to hear that they started making their own list&#x2014;and that they want to send it to me, and talk about it!</p> <p> I&#x2019;d also like everyone to dig out their most embarrassing guilty pleasure (mine is the Pussycat Dolls, as you&#x2019;ll soon find out) and tell me all about it.</p> <br><strong>Q:</strong> I&#x2019;m not a girl. Is there anything here for me? <br> <p><strong>A:</strong> While there are a few "girly" things in this book, most of it is for anyone who likes to talk about music more than is socially acceptable. It happens to be told from a female perspective, but anyone who can stomach listening to a lady talk for 200+ pages (and in this day and age, I would hope that&#x2019;s everyone) should find something that reminds them of an awful--or awesome--thing they&#x2019;ve done, and the soundtrack that was playing when they did it.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How did your background in the music industry affect your writing?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The first thing it did was give me lots and lots of crazy stories about musicians&#x2014; some of which I couldn&#x2019;t dream of retelling, because I would get in too much trouble. Early on, I learned that meeting your idols is almost always a bad idea. Except Elvis Costello who is, of course, charming and wonderful and generous and the greatest person ever.</p> <p> The weekly debates at MTV over which videos to add to the lineup--I called it MTV Fight Club--heavily influenced the way I evaluate music, and gave me quite a lot of insight into how different musicians are marketed. It was always fun when the debates turned into passionate arguments and forced me to look at music analytically, as well as from the perspective of a fan.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You seem to take music very personally. How did you decide what to include from your own personal life in your essays? Was there anything off-limits?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Look, after my friend Gina made me admit to liking the Pussycat Dolls, it was pretty clear nothing was off-limits. That, more than anything, is what I was embarrassed to write in the book, but it had to be said. "Guilty Pleasures" is all the better&#x2014;and all the more absurd&#x2014;for it. </p> <p>In an early draft, "Rock and Roll Consorts" was based around a playlist from my relationship with a rock star, but I sounded so bitter and insane that I scrapped it before the book was even a proposal. There is no way I would ever tell anyone what was on that playlist; after writing it down, I realized it was much too personal. I&#x2019;m sure there are people who wish I were as private about all my relationships, but those are the breaks!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>What's been the response from your friends and industry associates who've seen themselves in your essays?</p> <p><strong> A:</strong> My mom was annoyed that I implied she had mom-like taste in music in "Guilty Pleasures," but she understands it was done for comedic effect. For the record, she has very good and rather adventurous taste in music.</p> <p> Most of the people in the book saw I wrote about them in advance, so there won&#x2019;t be any big surprises. A few people corrected my memories of events, which I very much wanted them to do. Historical accuracy is important. Only one person asked me to make any changes&#x2014;and rightly so&#x2014;but on the whole, everyone was extremely indulgent and told me to write whatever I wanted. Even though a few friends told me it was weird, they still can&#x2019;t wait to read the whole book, which I am taking as a good sign. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Come on, now. What do you have against The Smiths?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Seriously. Think about your mindset when you listen to The Smiths. Do you not put them on when you&#x2019;re depressed and self-indulgent? When you feel the world has done you wrong? When you feel unloved and sulky? I absolutely indulge in The Smiths now and then, when circumstances demand it. However, a totally-in-love superfan? No, I don&#x2019;t want to date that. It&#x2019;s just not my cup of tea. We can still be friends though. Possibly.</p> <p></p>Courtney Smith has more than a decade of experience working in the music industry.

They play their piano from the front porch because the movers left it with the keyboard facing the parlor window, and they're ready to raise the ceiling to make way for a towering Christmas tree. Only the timely intervention of "the wise old lady from Philadelphia" keeps them from acting on their more elaborate madcap schemes.<br>Author Lucretia Hale, sister to writer and cleric Edward Everett Hale, helped break new ground in children's literature by writing stories to amuse young people rather than instruct or uplift them.

The gun industry needs and is due for the next big breakthrough. Every 100 years seems to bring the next big development in firearms technology. In the 1600&#x2019;s the wheel lock was developed and heralded the first use of firearms. In the 1700&#x2019;s came the flintlock musket. In the 1800&#x2019;s came the percussion cap and later in the century the thin brass shell to carry the powder, ball ammunition, and primer was perfected. While the 20th century has seen the invention of liquid propellant, caseless ammunition, and the gyrojet, the thin brass shell has been hard to beat and is still the dominant way to feed ammunition to the firearms of today. We are due for the next big advance, but from where will it come? This book was written to interest the reader on the simplicity and the hidden complexity that good gun designs exhibit and prompt the imagination of the reader to investigate the field of firearms design further. Reading this book will give the reader: � Two ways to calculate the round per minute level of a 9mm caliber submachine gun using the STEN submachine gun as an example and gives sample excel spreadsheets to allow the reader to experiment with different design conditions. � The full technical data package of a reverse engineered STEN Submachine gun. The drawings are shown as individual operation process sheets showing the dimensions for each separate cut on an individual drawing. � The cycle of operations of the STEN with illustrations. � The analysis and sample calculations to design a gun barrel. � A discussion of firearm metallurgy with recommendations on material selection and heat treatment for various components. This book is unique as it is not a picture book of firearms, a combat guide on how to use them, nor discusses their maintenance or care. It does expose the engineering that can go behind a gun design project. This book not only gives the reader the drawings for a gun but also explains the engineering and dynamics behind it.</p><p>The author, David Findlay, has spent his entire life around firearms and in the field of gun design. The author first worked for 26 years at Remington Arms as a designer and in middle management in charge of other gun designers and firearms acceptance testing. He then worked four years for Marlin Firearms/H&amp;R 1871 as a product engineer and later in charge of the engineering group at H&amp;R 1871. Currently he is employed by Smith &amp; Wesson as a product engineer. David&#x2019;s experience has included working on the following Remington product lines; M/870, M/1100, M/1187, M/522 Viper, M/700, and SP-10 Magnum. While at H&amp;R 1871, David was involved in improving product quality, product performance, and new line extensions of both their rifle and shotgun single shot product lines. Now at Smith &amp; Wesson, David has worked on the M&amp;P 4 full auto, the M&amp;P 15 semi-auto long gun lines, and has also worked on the Thompson Center product lines as a product engineer. Along the way, the author has received eight patents: #5,373,775 Disconnector in Two Planes #5,442,874 Firearm Mag Box Alignment #5,448,939 Firearm with Multiple Sears #5,551,180 Releasable Bolt Lock #6,240,670 Firing Pin Lock #6,256,917 Firearm with Lockable Safety #8,261,652 Ambidextrous Bolt Stop #8,418,803 Flash Suppressor This is David Findlay&#x2019;s second book.</p><h2>Buso Renkin, Vol. 1 (1)</h2><p>Kazuki Mutou is mortally wounded saving a girl from a strange monster, but is given a new life through the power of the alchemically-made Core Iron.

His hobbies are to draw, read, play video games, read American comic books, and make model figures.In Watsuki's modern-day follow-up to his smash <i>Ruroni Kenshin</i>, we meet high school student Kazuhiko Muto, who dreams of rescuing a pretty schoolgirl from a hideous, tentacled beast. Is this vision just a product of his slumbering imagination? To his horror, Kazuhiko discovers that his dream is actually a terrifying reality and the creature that he battled is a "homunculus," one of a legion of man-eating monsters who hide among the general population in human guise until they can prey upon their victims. Luckily for Kazuhiko, the girl he rescued in his "dream" is a sorceress who seeks to wipe the homunculi from the face of the earth and has altered Kazuhiko's body with the power of alchemy and a talisman called the Kakugane, rendering him virtually unkillable, highly skilled in the fighting arts and empowered with the Buso Renkin, a mystical lance that can defeat the homunculi. Watsuki offers up strong artwork, clear storytelling, hyper-kinetic action, monsters, arcane weaponry and characters crying out their special moves, such as "Valkyrie Skirt!" and the titular "Buso Renkin!" This first volume is mostly setup, but Watsuki's fans will want to stay around for the ride. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I just . . . ah fuck, I just hate you . . . <br><br> The coat was ridiculous. <br><br> I got it at the secondhand store. <br><br> Think it was a hunting coat. <br><br> Had duck pictures on the inside.<br><br> It was the color of drug shit and half the buttons barely held. <br><br> Useless. <br><br> Useless!<br><br> First time I wore it I put my hands in the pockets and felt something and took out two handfuls of leaf dust.<br><br> And yes, I wanted to drop to my knees and hold the handfuls up and let them blow away as I screamed upward, &#x2018;Fuck you coat, I hate you!&#x2019; <br><br> Then scream, &#x2018;Just kidding/we&#x2019;re all trying!&#x2019; <br><br> The wind burned my face. <br><br> My eyes teared. <br><br> I scraped ice off my mustache with my lower teeth, then scraped ice off the hair below my lip with my front teeth. <br><br> Goodbye tiny icicles. <br><br> Goodbye and that&#x2019;s all.<br><br> No more. <br><br> No more!<br><br> There were only two ways to keep warm. <br><br> One was to give in and die, to sit your dumb ass down and let it happen.<br><br> The other was to drum with your teeth while making fists in your pockets and repeatedly yelling &#x2018;Fuck you&#x2019; in your head. <br><br> That helped. <br><br> That definitely helped. <br><br> It was renewing in some way, which of course immediately passed. <br><br> I saw two construction workers on the sidewalk. <br><br> They huddled over a blue tarp with the head of a dog coming out the front. <br><br> The dog shivered in one long body spasm, wheezing and honking, like &#x2018;ung ung ung.&#x2019; <br><br> One construction worker hugged the dog, rubbing up and down on its chest. <br><br> &#x2018;Yeah when he saw me, he got scared and slipped and fell into this ditch and the ice broke and he went into the water. I figured I can rub him and maybe he&#x2019;ll warm up faster.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Oh fuck, he went in the water?&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Yeah.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Fuck, what should we do, he&#x2019;s gonna die.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, guy.&#x2019;<br><br> The dog stared at me as I passed.<br><br> I wanted to teach him to drum with his teeth while screaming &#x2018;Fuck you&#x2019; in his head. <br><br> Because that was all he needed. <br><br> But somehow it just didn&#x2019;t matter. <br><br> No. <br><br> I scraped new icicles off my moustache with my bottom teeth.<br><br> My eyes stuck shut for a few seconds. <br><br> I made fists in my pockets and moaned. <br><br> Took my hands out of my pockets and held my nose. <br><br> One last gust of wind hit my face as I went down the stairs for the train. <br><br> Haha, yeah, you win. <br><br> But fuck you too. <br><br> The train was already there, doors about to close.<br><br> I ran and jumped in the closest car and went to the back and leaned against the door to the next car so I could be furthest away from/see everyone. <br><br> There was puke on one of the seats and the window behind it&#x2015;like someone not only puked, but his/her head filled with puke then exploded.<br><br> Fuck yeah, that&#x2019;s how you do it. <br><br> It was the garbage times. <br><br> *<br><br> When I got to the bar, the sun had set. <br><br> Fuck you, bar. <br><br> I went down the alley and entered through the basement. <br><br> I kicked an empty case of rum across the room and ducked under a garbage bag stapled to the ceiling to collect drips. <br><br> The basement was filthy. <br><br> There was garbage all over.<br><br> Any job I&#x2019;d ever had involved garbage. <br><br> I had been, and always would be, a garbage man. <br><br> And yes, I took great pride in my garbage pedigree.<br><br> It was my calling. <br><br> My very meaning.<br><br> Something dripped on my head. <br><br> I touched my head.<br><br> Thick, dark green gel on my hand&#x2015;like pureed spinach. <br><br> Oh hello! <br><br> I was just talking about you to someone!<br><br> And how are you? <br><br> Nice. <br><br> I wiped my hand on my pants. <br><br> Garbage garbage, all my beautiful friends. <br><br> First I did dumpsters. <br><br> The dumpsters were full of broken glass and liquid collected from chutes connected upstairs.<br><br> With that classic vinegar smell that cleared my face. <br><br> Hoooo. <br><br> Yeah. <br><br> Some good shit. <br><br> When I grabbed the handles on a dumpster I cut my hands on broken glass. <br><br> I held up my hands to check on them.<br><br> They were the smallest pieces of broken glass I&#x2019;d ever seen. <br><br> So small they could only be seen in certain angles. <br><br> They were beautiful and I loved them and I smiled. <br><br> I wheeled the dumpster to the back stairwell, up to the narrow concrete staircase. <br><br> The staircase was covered in broken glass, with exposed nails along the handrails. <br><br> I had to wheel the dumpsters up a rickety ramp chained up on either side of the stairs. <br><br> I unchained the ramp and lined up the dumpster wheels. <br><br> It was supposed to be something two people did but no one else did it so I just did it myself. <br><br> Because it was the garbage times.<br><br> Where best to just shut the fuck up and do what you had to do.<br><br> <b><p>From WHITE IBIS</p></b> 1.<br><br> &#x2018;Just, whatever,&#x2019; I said, standing in a drugstore aisle with my girl. &#x2018;Grab whatever&#x2019;s gonna knock her out.&#x2019; <br><br> It was 2 a.m. and we were buying allergy medicine to drug our cat, Dotty, for the move from Chicago to Tampa Bay. <br><br> &#x2018;This should knock her out,&#x2019; said my girl. <br><br> A guy in the next aisle looked over. <br><br> I noticed him but the girl didn&#x2019;t. <br><br> &#x2018;We need to make sure she&#x2019;s out-out,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Like for good. We can&#x2019;t have her waking up halfway there. We just can&#x2019;t.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Yeah she can&#x2019;t wake up,&#x2019; she said. <br><br> &#x2018;Once she&#x2019;s out,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;we can stuff her in the cage and get her in the car. Then we&#x2019;re home free.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Alright yeah,&#x2019; she said, shaking the pills. &#x2018;These should do then.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Cool, so what do we do? Mash some up and put it in her dinner.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Yep.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;Niiiiice,&#x2019; I said, smiling. <br><br> My girl kissed me on the cheek. <br><br> A couple hours later when the sun came up, I was still awake. <br><br> Sitting on the broken couch we were leaving behind, in an otherwise empty apartment. <br><br> An apartment that owed us nothing, not even a security deposit. <br><br> Dotty pushed around a styrofoam bowl of drugged food while my girl took a shit. <br><br> And the sun came in through the peephole behind me, projecting a flowing circle of rainbow colors onto the wall. <br><br> Like a quarter-sized jellyfish.<br><br> I sat there staring at it as it waved on the wall.<br><br> A portal.<br><br> An exit.<br><br> Like I could&#x2019;ve put my hands on either side of it and stepped in, to find something else. A new home.<br><br> The next level. <br><br> Something else.<br><br> &#x2018;Ready?&#x2019; I said, as my girl exited the bathroom holding her stomach. And we went through the portal. <br><br> 2. <br><br> We pulled up to her brother&#x2019;s house in Tampa at 5 a.m. the next day. <br><br> We were living there while her brother lived in New York. <br><br> And we&#x2019;d fit all our shit in her car. <br><br> As I braked, a cymbal and some paintings fell forward and hit me in the neck. <br><br> Dotty screamed, &#x2018;oowwwwwwrrrrr&#x2019;&#x2015;covered in her own piss and shit [for the third time] and still awake. <br><br> &#x2018;We did it!&#x2019; I said, stepping outside into the humidity.<br><br> The air carried the scent of some beautiful flower.<br><br> And the insects beeped and whirred. <br><br> I looked around at the dark bayou as it swayed in the moonlight. Florida. <br><br> I had moved to Florida.<br><br> The girl and I unpacked a couple things and brought them inside.<br><br> Then we drank a bunch of water and had sex on the couch.<br><br> She lay down next to me, breathing hard.<br><br> She fell asleep and I lay with her, staring at a message on the kitchen whiteboard. Her parents lived nearby.<br><br> And her mom, in red ink, had written, &#x2018;Welcome Home! :)&#x2019;<br><br> The other side of the sunlight portal.<br><br> The next level.<br><br> Something else. <br><br> 3. <br><br> I met many new kinds of animals in the bayou. <br><br> In Chicago there were two kinds of animals: squirrels and rocks. <br><br> But in Florida there were all kinds. <br><br> There were armadillos, which were basically like small armored pigs that wobbled around at night, into and out of sewers. <br><br> I badly wanted to pick one up and hold it like a baby or throw it like a football, but I found out they carried leprosy. <br><br> So, uh, no thanks! <br><br> Then there were possums, which were basically bigger/greasier rats. <br><br> Like imagine a rat that broke a vial of some futuristic steroid over its head. <br><br> Every time I saw one, they paused and glared at me in the moonlight, like, &#x2018;Take a good look, yoomin.&#x2019; <br><br> There were alligators. <br><br> Bobcats. <br><br> Snakes. <br><br> Lizards everywhere. <br><br> Millions of bugs, including one named after not being able to see it [which. for that very reason, was the worst.] <br><br> Spiders and frogs and birds.<br><br> All kinds of birds.<br><br> Gawky-ass, ornate birds just walking around.<br><br> Like this one that basically lived at the end of the driveway.<br><br> Every time I went outside, it&#x2019;d be shuffling around where the driveway met the street.<br><br> Not really doing anything or going anywhere, just kind of pacing.<br><br> With a long white neck and a really long orange beak, walking around like a dumbass on its stilt legs. <br><br> Like what the fuck is this thing?<br><br> It was out tonight when the girl and I got on our bikes to go to the gas station.<br><br> &#x2018;Yo, what&#x2019;s up, pea-head,&#x2019; I said, as we pedaled past.<br><br> The bird took a few steps in the other direction, head sideways, eyeing us. <br><br> My girl laughed. <br><br> &#x2018;I love that thing,&#x2019; I said. <br><br> &#x2018;That&#x2019;s a white ibis,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;My grammy knows them all.&#x2019; <br><br> White ibis. <br><br> Why, hello, white ibis. I really wanted the white ibis to like me and to be my friend. <br><br> And to its credit, it&#x2015;seemingly&#x2015;did not. <br><br> OK. <br><br> Well. <br><br> Hell, I understood. <br><br> Made sense. <br><br> &#x2018;Fuckin pea-head,&#x2019; I said to myself, turning onto a slippery street. <br><br> &#x2018;Are you still talking about that bird,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Hey, you wanna get black-out drunk.&#x2019; <br><br> &#x2018;No, goddamnit,&#x2019; I said, almost falling. <br><br> I should&#x2019;ve just fallen. <br><br> The humidity covered everything. <br><br> It was getting dark. <br><br> And all the animals headed back to their corners, to wait for tomorrow. <br><br></p><h2>Poems: A Concise Anthology</h2><p><p> Presenting a broad range of fully annotated selections from the long history of poetry in English, this anthology provides a rich and extensive resource for teaching traditional canons and forms as well as experimental and alternate trajectories (such as Language poetry and prose poetry). In addition to a chronological table of contents suited to a literary-historical course framework, the volume offers a list of conceptual and thematic teaching units called &#x201c;Poems in Conversation.&#x201d; Instructors will find the Conversations helpful for lesson plans; students will find them equally helpful as a resource for presentation and paper topics. Headnotes to each poet are designed to be useful to both instructors and students in the classroom: for instructors new to particular poets, the headnotes will provide helpful grounding in the most current scholarship; for students, they will provide frameworks and explanations to help them approach unfamiliar texts. </p> <p> As a unique feature in the current market, this anthology also incorporates contemporary song lyrics from alternative, indie, rap, and hip-hop songs, fully integrated into the Conversations as rich material for teaching in the under�graduate classroom. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Renker</strong> is Professor of English at The Ohio State University. She is the recipient of many teaching awards and has published widely on nineteenth-century American poetry. In 2012, <em>The Princeton Review</em> named her one of the top 300 professors in the nation, across all universities and disciplines. </p><p> &#x201c;Reflecting contemporary interest in transnational connections, Elizabeth Renker&#x2019;s comprehensive anthology will foster enlivened pedagogy; the volume is enhanced by its alternative table of contents, tactfully informative headnotes, and web-based supplementary readings. Thematic emphases such as love and self-discovery will especially appeal to students. <em>Poems</em> simultaneously invites and challenges readers, encompassing familiar selections by established poets, thought-provoking contributions by newcomers, widely varying forms, and diverse authors. Anyone who teaches poetry&#x2015;or simply loves it&#x2015;will appreciate the anthology&#x2019;s multiple pleasures and opportunities.&#x201d; &#x2015; Karen L. Kilcup, University of North Carolina at Greensboro </p> <p> &#x201c;<em>Poems: A Concise Anthology</em> is truly concise, covering over one thousand years of poetry in English in a single volume. It is also remarkably capacious, offering selections from a wide array of poets. Alongside canonical writers from Chaucer to Emily Dickinson to Seamus Heaney, the editor has included recently recovered work by women and African American writers. Popular songs make up part of the selection. A substantial selection of poetry by writers working today are included. The headnotes are succinct and well-informed. Glosses of unfamiliar words and spare but necessary notes help without bogging down the reader. The broad array of materials offers maximum flexibility to instructors in syllabus design. This book provides everything necessary for introductory poetry classes and undergraduate poetry classes more generally. It will be a pleasure to use for both students and instructors.&#x201d; &#x2015; Eliza Richards, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill </p> <p> &#x201c;[I] enjoyed looking over the text and marveling at the selections.&#x201d;&#x2015; Mira Foote, Community College of Carroll County </p> <p>&#x201c;How often does a volume of poems that surveys centuries of its finest instances enable a professor to rethink her or his syllabus from top to bottom? <em>Poems: A Concise Anthology</em> inspired me to revitalize a course that was becoming predictable. I know of no other comparable textbook that offers a teacher a chance to draw upon the most resonant examples of canonical poetry, and simultaneously engenders discussions of the social roles that poetry might play in mobilizing literate communities still in a formative stage. Elizabeth Renker&#x2019;s astute editorial touch honors the metrical tradition, even as she expands the ground conditions of material and popular culture for lyrical praxis. Its survey of practitioners of avant-garde practitioners, in particular, usefully goes beyond mere token recognition and enables my current syllabus to recognize the full amplitude of contemporary poetry.&#x201d; &#x2015; Bill Mohr, Professor, California State University, Long Beach </p></p><h2>Day of Atonement: A Decker/Lazarus Novel (Decker/Lazarus Novels, 4)</h2><p><p>Peter Decker of the LAPD never dreamed he'd be spending his honeymoon with his new wife, Rina Lazarus, in an Orthodox Jewish enclave in Brooklyn, New York&#x2014;or that a terrible event would end it so abruptly. But a boy has vanished from the midst of this close-knit religious community, a troubled youth fleeing the tight bonds and strictures he felt were strangling him.</p><p>The runaway, Noam, is not traveling alone. A killer has taken him under his wing to introduce Noam to a savage world of blood and terror. And now Decker must find them both somewhere in America before a psychopath ends the life of a confused and frightened youngster whose only sin was to want something more."Kellerman is splendid."</p></p><p>Part of my responsiblities as mass market managing editor of Ballantine includes handling reprints. In addition to updating front and back matter in order to keep everything up to date, I make sure that any text changes that need to be made are indeed made. This could include anything from factual information that an author wants to change to simple misspellings (although we pride ourselves in having many books with zero typos). Well, recently I received a letter that had originally been sent from a reader to Faye Kellerman, who sent it on to us. The reader wrote about how much she loves Faye's books, and she was shocked to find a few typos in one of the books. I reviewed her list of "errors," and lo and behold, a couple of them absolutely had to be changed. Whenever a reader does something like this, I like to respond with a letter of my own, along with a copy of the book with the corrections made. But in this case there was only a return address; nowhere was there a name. I looked at the address again; it sounded awful familiar. I searched the remnants of my limited brain and suddenly realized that the letter had come from one of my best friends' mothers. And I could see Mrs. R's style all over it. I immediately called my friend and told him about it; we decided to do nothing until the next reprint comes out, with the corrections. Then I'll send a copy of the book, with a note from me, thanking Mrs. R for all her help. I guess the world gets a little smaller every day. . . .<br><br>Mark Rifkin, Managing EditorialL.A. detective Peter Decker and his Jewish bride, Rina Lazarus, are spending their honeymoon in the unlikely locale of Brooklyn, celebrating the Jewish High Holidays.

But it's tough getting anyone to open up about a missing kid nobody likes, especially in a close-knit Orthodox society where Decker is clearly an outsider.

But then one day someone bigger and uglier and maybe even meaner arrives . . . and suddenly Ugly Fish isn't feeling <i>quite</i> so confident anymore. <br> <br>From Kara LaReau, author of the Rocko and Spanky series, here is an irreverent and terrifically funny book about a bully who at last gets his comeuppance. <br></p><p>Author Kara LaReau has also worked as a children's book editor.<br> &nbsp;<br><br>SCOTT MAGOON is an art director who has written and illustrated several acclaimed picture books, including Hugo and Miles in I&#x2019;ve Painted Everything. He lives in Reading, Massachusetts.With his murky green skin and fierce underbite, Ugly Fish rules the aquarium. "He liked gliding in... and out... of his driftwood tunnel. He liked eating his special briny flakes." But he hates to share. Each time a potential friend is introduced, he snarls, "There's only room for one fish in this tank-me!" He devours all interlopers, including cute yellow Teensy Fish and the cuddly duo of Stripey and Spotty Fish. In post-meal images, readers witness Ugly's pleased expression and see the victim's fin dangling from his toothy jaw; when he's lonely, he does express mild remorse ("Chasing those fish was fun. If only I hadn't eaten them"). Shortly thereafter, dark-blue Shiny Fish-so enormous he doesn't fit on the page, and with sinister dark circles under his narrow eyes-joins Ugly in the tank. Ugly acts as though he has learned his lesson, and tries to welcome the hulking newcomer. But predator becomes prey, and Shiny gets "a nice new home... [burp] all to himself." Magoon pictures the action in close-up, except for a wordless closing image of solitary Shiny, content in the rectangular tank. In this conclusion, Magoon implies the tiny territory for which the fish compete, and not least, the human hand in the fishy murders. LaReau's text, meanwhile, describes a bully's grim comeuppance. But however satisfying the vigilante justice, only a bigger bully trumps a petty tyrant. This cautionary tale shows that violence begets violence, but never suggests an alternative to the big-fish-eat-little-fish cycle. Ages 3-7. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>Grade 1-4&#x2013;Ugly Fish is big, mean, and not keen on sharing his space with others. Whenever new tank-mates arrive, he chases them around and then eats them. Once they're gone, he wishes that he had someone to play with and regrets his actions. However, wishes can be dangerous things, and soon Shiny Fish arrives on the scene. He is much larger than Ugly Fish and looks vaguely sharklike. Ugly Fish, lonely no more, proudly shows his new friend around the tank. Impressed, Shiny Fish decides he wants it all to himself, and, after a short chase, polishes off Ugly Fish with a burp. Edgy pen-and-ink, digitally colored cartoon illustrations perfectly complement the short text's dry and wicked humor. The comically exaggerated details within the sharp pictures prevent the plot from becoming too heavy. While not for the faint of heart, this book will appeal to many kids; they'll thoroughly enjoy its humor and shock value.<i>&#x2013;Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA</i> <br> (<i>School Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>Didn&#39;t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!

Men are sensing the backlash and are consciously and unconsciously going on strike.&#x201d; They are dropping out of college, leaving the workforce and avoiding marriage and fatherhood at alarming rates. The trend is so pronounced that a number of books have been written about this man-child&#x201d; phenomenon, concluding that men have taken a vacation from responsibility simply because they can. But why <i>should</i> men participate in a system that seems to be increasingly stacked against them? <br><br>As <i>Men on Strike</i> demonstrates, men aren&#x2019;t dropping out because they are stuck in arrested development. They are instead acting <i>rationally</i> in response to the lack of incentives society offers them to be responsible fathers, husbands and providers. In addition, men are going on strike, either consciously or unconsciously, because they do not want to be injured by the myriad of laws, attitudes and hostility against them for the crime of happening to be male in the twenty-first century. Men are starting to fight back against the backlash. <i>Men on Strike</i> explains their battle cry.<br><br></p><p>Helen Smith, PhD, is a psychologist specializing in forensic issues and men&#x2019;s issues in Knoxville, Tennessee.

She lives in South Haven, Michigan.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Beautiful design enhances this delightful cautionary tale. Told in a folkloric style, it tells of a poor old man living a spartan existence in the forest with only his beloved cat for company. While foraging for wild strawberries one day, the man hears a cry for help. Alarmed, he grabs a stick and runs in the direction of the voice. There he spies a "wee small man" caught in the jaws of a fox. He hurls the stick at the beast and the little fellow drops to the ground, injured. The old man tends the sprite for several days and the two get on famously. Then one morning, the little man is gone, but a few days later a beautiful bowl appears on the doorstep with a note. The full belly bowl is a thank-you gift to be used wisely. Experimentation reveals that it will multiply anything placed within it. This, as the old man learns, is a mixed blessing when a spider alights in the enchanted vessel. Predictably, the old fellow becomes greedy and careless and the bowl is finally broken and useless. He then rediscovers contentment in his humble existence and is grateful for the final companionable gift provided by the magic.

In it, Levi examines with great precision and insight the inner meanings of Qabalism and their relationship to the occult sciences. Part One is a commentary on the Spihra Dzeniuta by Simeon Ben-Jochal, which includes an examination of the affinities between Qabalism and Freemasonry. Part Two pursues the correspondences between Qabalism, Numerology and the Tarot. This edition includes an appendix by Papus (Dr. Gerard Encausse) summarizing Levi&#39;s doctrines and teachings and supplying some fascinating information on some of the master&#39;s many disciples.</p><p><b> <p>Alphonse Louis Constant, better know by his pen name Eliphas Levi, was a master of the traditional Rosicrucian interpretation of the Kabbalah. He was born in France in 1810, and through the offices of the parish priest, was educated for the church at SaintSulpice. He was later expelled from seminary for teaching doctrines contrary to those of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1824 Levi began studying the occult sciences, and wrote about magic and the Kabbalah for the next three decades. His other books include <i>Transcendental Magic</i>, <i>Mysteries of the Qabalah</i>, and <i>The Book of Splendours</i>.</p> </b>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Boiling Frogs: Intel vs. The Village</h2><p>The story goes that if you throw a frog into a pot of boiling water, he will jump out and save himself. If you place the same frog in a pot of cool water and slowly bring it to a boil, he will allow himself to be boiled to death. This is exactly what is happening to millions of people around the world. Industry has introduced tens of thousands of chemical compounds into our human environment since World War II. We are the frogs in a vast scientific experiment.In 1992, Intel Corporation tightened its grip on the mesa above the village of Corrales, New Mexico, building its two-billion-dollar flagship plant there. Soon the battle is on between the unholy triad of big money, big business, and politics and a band of &#34;quaint guerillas&#34; that see their peaceful rural lifestyle threatened by the new neighbor on the hill.Touted as a &#34;clean industry,&#34; residents soon find out that making computer chips is anything but clean, as tons of toxic chemicals pollute the air they breathe, and their water is pumped out from under them at an alarming rate. Boiling Frogs is a shocking tell-all, a fully documented report of Intel&#39;s takeover of New Mexico, and a cautionary tale for anyone who wakes up to find out that a corporate monster has moved in next door.</p><p>Barbara Rockwell helped found a group that confronted Intel Rio Rancho on air pollution.

For thirty years they fought a bloody battle for control of New York's underworld to emerge as the nation's richest and most powerful crime family. Now Mafia expert John H. Davis tells their compelling inside story. <p>Here are the chilling details and deceptions that created a vast criminal empire. Here are six decades of the uncontrolled greed and lust for power of such men as Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Meyer Lansky, Vito Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano, and John Gotti--men for whom murder and betrayal were business as usual. From the Gambinos' powerful stranglehold on New York's construction, garment, and waterfront industries to the government's onslaught against them in the `80s and `90s, <em> Mafia Dynasty </em> takes you into the mysterious world of blood oaths, shifting alliances, and deadly feuds that will hold you riveted from the first page to the last.</p><p></p></p><p>During the 1920s the Gambinos, members of the New York Cosa Nostra "Five Families," which also included the Colombo, Bonanno, Lucchese and Genovese families, controlled many businesses in Gotham. Among their strongholds were private carting, garment industry trucking and construction. The mob also had a powerful pull in the meat and supermarket businesses, along with the customary enterprises of loansharking, extortion and pornography. Additionally, the dons, having forbidden trafficking in drugs to subordinates, could not resist the vast profits and became involved themselves. Mafia founding fathers Vincent and Philip Mangano were succeeded by Albert Anastasia, who was murdered in 1957. The most effective leader, shows Davis, was Carlo Gambino, who emerged supreme in 1970, reigned for 19 years and was succeeded by his cousin Paul Castellano until he was killed at the behest of John Gotti, who was sentenced to life in prison in 1992. Davis ( Mafia Kingfish ) explores the history of the Cosa Nostra from its roots in Italy and brilliantly depicts the violent, vicious, vulgar brotherhood. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of New York City's five Mafia families, the Gambinos have been variously bossed by Albert Anastasia, Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano, and--until his recent conviction (life imprisonment without parole)--most infamously by the flamboyant John Gotti. The author believes, perhaps prematurely, that the government's court victories have spelled the Mafia's doom. Davis, whose most recent work was Mafia Kingfish ( LJ 12/88), is most successful in chapters on Gotti and his final trial. Less inspired, though adequate, is the historical material, which has all been done before. In addition to John Cummings and Ernest Volkman's Goombata ( LJ 4/15/90) and Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci's Mob Star (Watts, 1988), we can expect more books about Gotti; until then, this latest account is suitable for organized crime collections.<br><i>- Gregor A.

Hainsworth's study meets this problem through examples of what Petrarch wrote, and does so decisively and succinctly. . . . [A] careful and unpretentious book, penetrating in its organization and treatment of its subject, gentle in its guidance of the reader, nimble and dexterous in its scholarly infrastructure&#x2014;and no less profound for those qualities of lightness. The translations themselves are a delight, and are clearly the result of profound meditation and extensive experiment. . . . The Introduction and the notes to each work form a clear plexus of support for the reader, with a host of deft cross-references. --Richard Mackenny, Binghamton University, State University of New York</p><p><p>Peter Hainsworth is Emeritus Fellow and Professor of Italian, Oxford University.</p>Hainsworth's translations from the Italian are first-rate, both in terms of accuracy to the intent of the originals . . . and in terms of conveying the force of Petrarch&#x2019;s imagery. The translations from the Latin read freshly and easily . . . they are sure-footed, managing to capture the mix of pride and playfulness which characterizes Petrarch's composite prose style. The notes to the individual poems are well-judged, just enough to keep the reader on track without parading off-putting erudition. --Jonathan Usher, Emeritus, University of Edinburgh<br><br><p>A judicious selection of the varied writings of the great humanist, translated from both Latin and Italian. The Introduction is admirably structured, clear, and coherent, and presents Petrarch to the reader without didacticism or oversimplification. Hainsworth has a light editorial touch. . . . All in all, a luminous portrait of the 'father of humanism'. --David Marsh, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</p></p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Differential Geometry (Schaum&#39;s)</h2><p><p><b>Confusing Textbooks?
